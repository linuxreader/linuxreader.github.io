## Permission Classes and Types

**Permission classes**
- user (u)
- group (g)
- other (o) (public)
- all (a) <- all combined

**Permission types**
- r,w,x
- works differently on files and directories
- hyphen (-) represents no permissions set

### ls results permissions groupings 
- - rwx rw- r--
	- user (owner), group, and other (public)
### ls results first character meaning
- regular file
d directory
l symbolic link
c character device file
b block device file
p named pipe
s socket
	

### Modifying Access Permission Bits

### `chmod`  command 
- Modify permissions using symbolic or octal notation.
- Used by root or the file owner.

Flags
chmod -v ::: Verbose.

### Symbolic notation 
- Letters (ugo/rwx) and symbols (+, -, =) used to add, revoke, or assign permission bits.

### Octal Notation 
Three-digit numbering system ranging from 0 to 7.
	0 ---
	1 --x
	2 -w-
	3 -wx
	4 r--
	5 r-x
	6 rw-
	7 rwx

### Default Permissions
- Calculated based on the umask (user mask) value subtracted from the initial permissions value.

#### umask 
- Three-digit value (octal or symbolic) that refers to read, write, and execute permissions for owner, group, and public.
- Default umask value is 0022 for the root user and 0002 normal users.
- The left-most 0 has no significance.
- If umask is set to 000 files will get max of 666
- If the initial permissions are 666 and the umask is 002 then the default permissions are 664. (666-002)
- Any new files or directories created after changing the umask will have the new default permissions set. 
- umask settings are lost when you log off. Add it to the appropriate startup file to make it permanent.

Defaults
- files 666 rw-rw-rw-
- directories 777 rwxrwxrwx

### umask command

Options
- -S symbolic form 

### Special Permission Bits
---
- 3 types of special permission bits for executable files or directories for non root users
	- setuid
	- setgid
	- sticky
- setuid 
	- set on exe's to provide non-owners the ability to run them with the privileges of the owning user
	- may be set on directories and files but will have no effect.
	- example: the su command
	- shows an 's' in ls -l listing at the end of owners permissions
	- If the file already has the “x” bit set for the user, the long listing will show a lowercase “s”, otherwise it will list it with an uppercase “S”.
- setgid 
	- set on exe's to provide non-group members the ability to run them with the privileges of the owning group.
	- May be set on shared directories
		- allow files and subdirectories created underneath to automatically inherit the directory’s owning group.
		- saves group members who are sharing the directory contents from changing the group ID for every new file and subdirectory that they add.
	- write command has this set by default so a member of the tty group can run it. If the file already has the “x” bit set for the group, the long listing will show a lowercase “s”, otherwise it will list it with an uppercase “S”.
- Sticky bit 
	- may be set on public directories for inhibiting file deletion by non-owners
	- may be set on directories and files but will have no effect.
	- Set on /tmp and /var/tmp by default
	- Letter "t" in other permission feild	
	- If the directory already has the “x” bit set for public, the long listing will show a lowercase “t”, otherwise it will list it with an uppercase “T”.

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- Setting a default ACL on a directory allows content sharing among user's without having to modify access on each new file and subdirectory.
- Extra permissions that can be set on files and directories.
- Define permissions for named user and named groups.
- Configured the same way on both files and directories.
- Named Users
	- May or may not be a part of the same group.
- 2 different groups of ACLs. Default ACLs and Access ACLs.
	- Access ACLs
		- Set on individual files and directories
	- Default ACLs
		- Applied on directories
		- files and subdirectories inherit the ACL
		- Execute bit must be set on the directory for public.
		- Files receive the shared directory's default ACLs as their access ACLs - what the mask limits.
		- Subdirectories receive both default ACLs and access ACLs as they are.

- A "+" at the end of ls -l listing indicates ACL is set
	- -rw-rw-r--+

### ACL Commands
`getfacl`
- Display ACL settings
	- Displays:
	- name of file
	- owner
	- owning group
	- Permissions
		- colon characters save space for named user/group (or UID/GID) when extended Permissions are set.
		- Example: user:1000:r--
			- the named user with UID 1000, who is neither the file owner nor a member of the owning group, is allowed read-only access to this file.
		- Example: group:dba:rw- 
			- give the named group (dba) read and write access to the file.
`setfacl`
	- set, modify, substitute, or delete ACL settings
	- If you want to give read and write permissions to a specific user (user1) and change the mask to read-only at the same time, the setfacl command will allocate the permissions as mentioned; however, the effective permissions for the named user will only be read-only.

u:UID:perms
- named user must exist in /etc/passwd
- if no user specified, permissions are given to the owner of the file/directory

g:GID:perms
- Named group must exist in /etc/group
- If no group specified, permissions are given to the owning group of the file/directory

o:perms
- Neither owner or owning group

m:perms
- Maximum permissions for named user or named group

Switches

| Switch | Description                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| -b     | Remove all Access ACLs          |
| -d     | Applies to default ACLs         |
| -k     | Removes all default ACLs        |
| -m     | Sets or modifies ACLs           |
| -n     | Prevent auto mask recalculation |
| -R     | Apply Recursively to directory  |
| -x     | Remove Access ACL               |
| -c     | Display output without header   |

### Mask Value

- Determine maximum allowable permissions for named user or named group
- Mask value displayed on separate line in getfacl output
- Mask is recalculated every time an ACL is modified unless value is manually entered.
- Overrides the set ACL value.

## Find Command

- Search files and display the full path.
- Execute command on search results.
- Different search criteria
	- name
	- part name
	- ownership
	- owning group
	- permissions
	- inode number
	- last access
	- modification time in days or minutes
	- size
	- file type
- Command syntax
	- {find} + {path} + {search option} + {action}
- Options
	- -name / -iname (search by name)

		- -exec  {} \\;
			- replaces {} for each filename as it is found. The semicolon character (;) marks the termination of the command and it is escaped with the backslash character (\\).
		- -ok  {} \\;
			- same as exec but requires confirmation.
	- -delete

# Advanced File Management Labs
### Lab: find stuff

1. Create file 10 and search for it.
```bash
[vagrant@server1 ~]$ sudo touch /root/file10
[vagrant@server1 ~]$ sudo find / -name file10 -print
/root/file10
```

2. Perform a case insensitive search for files and directories in /dev that begin with "usb" followed by any characters.
```bash
[vagrant@server1 ~]$ find /dev -iname usb*
/dev/usbmon0
```

3. Find files smaller than 1MB (-1M) in size (-size) in the root user’s home directory (~).
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ find ~ -size -1M
```

4. Search for files larger than 40MB (+40M) in size (-size) in the /usr directory:
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /usr -size +40M
/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.b
```

5. Find files in the entire root file system (/) with ownership (-user) set to user daemon and owning group (-group) set to any group other than (-not or ! for negation) user1:
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find / -user daemon -not -group user1
```

6. Search for directories (-type) by the name “src” (-name) in /usr at a maximum of two subdirectory levels below (-maxdepth):
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /usr -maxdepth 2 -type d -name src
/usr/local/src
/usr/src
```

7. Run the above search but at least three subdirectory levels beneath /usr, substitute -maxdepth 2 with -mindepth 3.
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /usr -mindepth 3 -type d -name src
/usr/src/kernels/4.18.0-425.3.1.el8.x86_64/drivers/gpu/drm//display/dmub/src
/usr/src/kernels/4.18.0-425.3.1.el8.x86_64/tools/usb/usbip/src
```

8. Find files in the /etc directory that were modified (-mtime) more than (the + sign) 2000 days ago:
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /etc -mtime +2000
/etc/libuser.conf
/etc/xattr.conf
/etc/whois.conf
```

9. Run the above search for files that were modified exactly 12 days ago, replace “+2000” with “12”.
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /etc -mtime 12
```

10. To find files in the /var/log directory that have been modified (-mmin) in the past (the - sign) 100 minutes:

[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /var/log -mmin 25
```

12. To search for block device files (-type) in the /dev directory with permissions (-perm) set to exactly 660:
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /dev -type b -perm 660
/dev/dm-1
/dev/dm-0
/dev/sda2
/dev/sda1
/dev/sda
```

13. Search for character device files (-type) in the /dev directory with at least (-222) world writable permissions (this example would ignore checking the write and execute permissions):
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /dev -type c -perm -222
```

14. Find files in the /etc/systemd directory that are executable by at least their owner or group members:
```bash
[vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find /etc/systemd -perm /110
```

15. Search for symlinked files (-type) in /usr with permissions (-perm) set to read and write for the owner and owning group:
```bash
 sudo find /usr -type l -perm -ug=rw
 ```

16. Search for directories in the entire directory tree (/) by the name “core” (-name) and list them (ls-ld) as they are discovered without prompting for user confirmation (-exec):
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 etc]$ sudo find / -name core -exec ls -ld {} \;
 ```

17. Use the -ok switch to prompt for confirmation before it copies each matched file (-name) in /etc/sysconfig to /tmp:
```bash
 sudo find /etc/sysconfig -name '*.conf' -ok  cp {} /tmp \;
 ```

### Lab: Display ACL and give permissions

1. Create and empty file aclfile1 in /tmp and display ACLs on it:
```bash
 cd /tmp
 touch aclfile1
 getfacl aclfile1
 ```
2. Give rw permission to user 1 but with a mask of read only and view the results.
```bash
 setfacl -m u:user1:rw,m:r aclfile1
```

3. Promote the mask value to include write bit and verify:
```bash
 setfacl -m m:rw aclfile1
 getfacl -c aclfile1
```

### Lab: Identify, Apply, and Erase Access ACLs
1. Switch to user1 and create file acluser1 in /tmp:
```bash
 su - user1
 cd /tmp
 touch acluser1
```

2. Use ls and getfacl to check existing acl entries:
```bash
 ls -l acluser1
 getfacl acluser1 -c
```

3. Allocate rw permissions to user100 with setfacl in octal form:
```bash
 setfacl -m u:user100:6 acluser1
```

4. Run ls (+) and getfacl to verify:
```bash
 ls -l acluser1
 getfacl -c acluser1
```
5. Open another terminal as user100 and open the file and edit it. 

6. Add user200 with full rwx permissions to acluser1 using the symbolic notation and then show the updated ACL settings:
```bash
 setfacl -m u:user200:rwx acluser1
 getfacl -c acluser1
```

7. Delete the ACL entries set for user200 and validate:
```bash
 setfacl -x u:user200 acluser1
 getfacl acluser1 -c
```
8. Delete the rest of the ACLs:
```bash
 setfacl -b acluser1
```
9. Use the ls and getfacl commands and confirm for the ACLs removal:
```bash
 ls -l acluser1
 getfacl acluser1 -c
```
10. create group aclgroup1 
```bash
 groupadd -g 8000 aclgroup1
```
11. add this group as a named group along with the two named users (user100 and user200).

### Lab: Apply, Identify, and erase default ACLs
1. Switch or log in as user1 and create a directory projects in /tmp:
```bash
 su - user1
 cd /tmp
 mkdir projects
```

2. Use the getfacl command for an initial look at the permissions on the directory:
```bash
 getfacl -c projects
```

3. Allocate default read, write, and execute permissions to user100 and user200 on the directory. Use both octal and symbolic notations and the -d (default) option with the setfacl command.
```bash
 setfacl -dm u:user100:7,u:user200:rwx projects/
 getfacl -c projects/
```

4. Create a subdirectory prjdir1 under projects and observe the ACL inheritance:
```bash
 mkdir prjdir1
 getfacl -c prjdir1
```

5. Create a file prjfile1 under projects and observe the ACL inheritance:
```bash
 touch prjfile1
 getfacl -c prjfilel
```

6. log in as one of the named users, change directory into /tmp/projects, and edit prjfile1 (add some random text). Then change into the prjdir1 and create file file100.
```bash
 su - user100
 cd /tmp/projects
 vim prjfile1
 ls -l prjfile1
 cd prjdir1
 touch file100
 pwd
```

7. Delete all the default ACLs from the projects directory as user1 and confirm:
```bash
 exit
 su - user1
 cd /tmp
 setfacl -k projects
 getfacl -c projects
```

8. create a group such as aclgroup2 by running groupadd -g 9000 aclgroup2 as the root user and repeat this exercise by adding this group as a named group along with the two named users (user100 and user200).

### Lab: Modify Permission Bits Using Symbolic Form

1. Add an execute bit for the owner and a write bit for group and public
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod u+x permfile1 -v
 mode of 'permfile1' changed from 0444 (r--r--r--) to 0544 (r-xr--r--)
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v go+w permfile1
 mode of 'permfile1' changed from 0544 (r-xr--r--) to 0566 (r-xrw-rw-)
```

2. Revoke the write bit from public
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v o-w permfile1
 mode of 'permfile1' changed from 0566 (r-xrw-rw-) to 0564 (r-xrw-r--)
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v a=rwx permfile1
 mode of 'permfile1' changed from 0564 (r-xrw-r--) to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)
```

3. Revoke write from the owning group and write and execute bits from public.
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod g-w,o-wx permfile1 -v
 mode of 'permfile1' changed from 0777 (rwxrwxrwx) to 0754 (rwxr-xr--)
```

 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ touch permfile2
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod 444 permfile2
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ ls -l permfile2
 -r--r--r--. 1 vagrant vagrant 0 Feb  4 12:22 permfile2
```

2. Add an execute bit for the owner:
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v 544 permfile2
 mode of 'permfile2' changed from 0444 (r--r--r--) to 0544 (r-xr--r--)
```

3. Add a write permission bit for group and public:
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v 566 permfile2
 mode of 'permfile2' changed from 0544 (r-xr--r--) to 0566 (r-xrw-rw-)
```

4. Revoke the write bit for public:
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v 564 permfile2
 mode of 'permfile2' changed from 0566 (r-xrw-rw-) to 0564 (r-xrw-r--)
```

5. Assign read, write, and execute permission bits to all three user categories:
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ chmod -v 777 permfile2
 mode of 'permfile2' changed from 0564 (r-xrw-r--) to 0777 (rwxrwxrwx)
```

6. Run the umask command without any options and it will display the current umask value in octal notation:
```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ umask
 0002
```

7. Symbolic form

```bash
 [vagrant@server1 ~]$ umask -S
 u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx

 usermod -a -G sgrp user2000
```

2. Set up appropriate ownership (root), owning group (sgrp), and permissions (rwx for group, --- for public, s for group, and t for public) on the directory to support group collaboration and ensure non-owners cannot delete files. 
```bash
 chgrp sgrp sdir
 chmod g=rwx,o=--- sdir
 chmod o+t sdir
 chmod g+s sdir
```

3. Log on as user1000 and create a file under /sdir. 
```bash
 su - user1000
 cd /sdir
 touch testfile
```

4. Log on as user2000 and try to edit that file. You should be able to edit the file successfully. 
```bash
 su - user200
 cd /sdir
 vim testfile
 cat testfile
```

5. As user2000 try to delete the file. You should not be able to. 
```bash
 rm testfile
```
### Lab: Find Files (root)
1. Search for all files in the entire directory structure that have been modified in the last 300 minutes and display their type. 
```bash
 find /sdir -mtime -300 -exec file {} \;
```
2. Search for named pipe and socket files. 
```bash
 find / -type p
 find / -type s
```
### Lab: Find Files Using Different Criteria (root)
1. Search for regular files under /usr that were accessed more than 100 days ago, are not bigger than 5MB in size, and are owned by the user root. 
```bash
 find /usr -type f -mtime +100 -size -5M -user root
```
### Lab: Apply ACL Settings (root)
1. Create file testfile under /tmp. 
```bash
 touch /tmp/testfile
```
2. Create users.
 ```bash
  adduser user2000
  adduser user3000
  adduser user4000
 ```
 
3. Apply ACL settings on the file so that user2000 gets 7, user3000 gets 6, and user4000 gets 4 permissions. 
```bash
 setfacl -m u:user2000:7 testfile
 setfacl -m u:user3000:6 testfile
 setfacl -m u:user4000:4 testfile
```

4. Remove the ACLs for user2000, and verify. 
```bash
 setfacl -x user2000 testfile
 getfacl testfile
```
 
5. Erase all remaining ACLs at once, and confirm.
```bash
 setfacl -b testfile
 getfacl testfile
```
