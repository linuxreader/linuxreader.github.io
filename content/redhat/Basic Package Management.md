## RPM (Redhat Package Manager)
- Specially formatted File(s) packaged together with the .rpm extension. 
- Packages included or available for RHEL are in rpm format.
- Metadata info gets updated whenever a package is updated.

### rpm command
- Install, Upgrade, remove, query, freshen, or decompress packages.
- Validate package authenticity and integrity.

### Packages
- Two types of packages binary (or installable) and source.

**Binary packages**
- Installation ready
- Bundled for distribution.
- Have .rpm extension.
- Contain:
	- install scripts (pre and post)
	- Executables
	- Configuration files
	- Library files
	- Dependency information
	- Where to install files
	- Documentation
		- How to install/uninstall
		- Man pages for config files/commands
		- Other install and usage info
	- Metadata
		- Stored in central location
		- Includes:
			- Package version
			- Install location
			- Checksum values
			- List of included files and their attributes
- Package intelligence
	- Used by package administration toolset for successful completion of the package installation process. 
	- May include info on:
		- prerequisites
		- User account setup
		- Needed directories/ soft links
	- Includes reverse process for uninstall

### Package Naming
5 parts to a package name:
	1. Name
	2. Version
	3. release (revision or build)
	4. Linux version 	
	5. Processor Architecture
		- noarch
			- platform independant
		- src
			- Source code packages
- Always has .rpm extension
- .rpm is removed after install
Example:
	openssl-1.1.1-8.el8.x86_64.rpm,

### Package Dependency
- Dependency info is in the metadata
	- Read by package handling utilities

### Package Database
- Metadata for installed packages and package files is stored in /var/lib/rpm/
	- Package database
	- Referenced by package manipulation utilities to obtain:
		- package name and version data
		- Info about owerships, permissions, timestamps, and file sizes that are part of the package.
		- Contain info on dependencies.
		- Aids management commands in:
			- listing and querying packages
			- Verifying dependencies and file attributes.
			- Installing new packages.
			- Upgrading and uninstalling packages. 
		- Removes and replaces metadata when a package is replaced. 
		- Can maintain multiple version of a single package. 

---


### Package Management Tools
- rpm (redhat package manager)
	- Does not automatically resolve dependencies.
- yum (yellowdog update, modified)
	- Find, get, and install dependencies automatically.
	- softlink to dnf now.
- dnf (dandified yum)

### Package management with rpm
rpm package management tasks:
	- query
	- install
	- upgrade
	- freshen
	- overwrite
	- remove
	- extract
	- validate
	- verify
- Works with installed and installable packages.

### Querying packages
Query packages in the package database or at a specified location. 

### Installing a package
- Creates directory structure needed
- Installs files
- Runs needed post installation steps
- Installing package will fail if missing dependencies.
- Error message will show missing dependencies.

### Upgrading a package
- Installs the package if previous version does not exist. (-U)
- Makes backup of effected configuration files and adds .rpmsave extension.

### Freshening a package
- Older version must exist. 
- -F option
- Will only work if a newer version of a package is available.

### Overwriting a Package
- Replaces existing files of a package with the same version.
- --replacepkgs option.
- Useful when you suspect corruption.

### Removing a Package
- Uninstalls package and associated files/ directories
- -e Option
- Checks to see if this package is a dependency for another program and fails if it is. 

### Extracting Files from an Installable Package
- `rpm2cpio` command
- -i (extract)
- -d create directory structure.
Useful for:
	- Examining package contents.
	- Replacing corrupt or lost command.
	- Replace critical configuration file to it's original state

## Package Integrity and Credibility
- MD5 Checksum for verifying package integrity
- GNU Privacy Guard Public Key (GNU Privacy Guard or GPG) for ensuring credibility of publisher. 
- PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) - commercial version of GPG.
- `--nosignature` 
	- Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.
- `-K` 
	- keep package files after installation
`rpmkeys` command
	- check credibility, import GPG key, and verify packages
- Redhat signs their products and updates with a GPG key. 
	- Files in installation media include public keys in the products for verification.
	- Copied to /etc/pki/rpm-gpg during OS installation. 
	**RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release**
		- Used for packages shipped after November 2009 and their updates.
	**RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-beta**
		- For Beta products shipped after November 2009.
- Import the relevant GPG key and the verify the package to check the credibility of a package. 

### Viewing GPG Keys
- view with rpm command `rpm -q gpg-pubkey`
- `-i` option
	- show info about a key. 

### Verifying Package Attributes
- Compare package file attributes with originals stored in package database at the time of installation.
- `-V` option
	- compare owner, group, permission mode, size, modification time, digest, type, etc. 
	- Returns to prompt if no changes are detected
	- -v or vv for verbose
- `-Vf`
	- run the check directly on the file
- Three columns of output:
	- Column 1
		- 9 fields
			- S = Different file size.
			- M = Mode or permission or file type change.
			- 5 = MD5 Checksum does not match.
			- D = Device file and its major and minor number have changed.

			- r = Readme file
	- Column 3
		- Full path of file

## Basic Package Management Labs

### Lab: Mount RHEL 9 ISO Persistently
1. Go to the VirtualBox VM Manager and make sure that the RHEL 8 image is attached to RHEL9-VM1 as depicted below:
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020240713164339.png)

2. Open the /etc/fstab file in the vim editor (or another editor of your choice) and add the following line entry at the end of the file to mount the DVD image (/dev/sr0) in read-only (ro) mode on the /mnt directory.

	```
	/dev/sr0 /mnt iso9660 ro 0 0
	```

Note: sr0 represents the first instance of the optical device and iso9660 is the standard format for optical file systems.

3. Mount the file system as per the configuration defined in the /etc/fstab file using the mount command with the -a (all) option:

	```
	sudo mount -a
	```

4. Verify the mount using the df command:

	```
	df -h | grep mnt
	```

Note: The image and the packages therein can now be accessed via the /mnt directory just like any other local directory on the system.

5. List the two directories—/mnt/BaseOS/Packages and /mnt/AppStream/Packages—that contain all the software packages (directory names are case sensitive):

	```
	ls -l /mnt/BaseOS/Packages | more
	```

### Lab: Query Packages (RPM)
1. query all installed packages:
	`rpm -qa`

2. query whether the perl package is installed:
	`rpm -q perl`

3. list all files in a package:
	`rpm -ql iproute`

4. list only the documentation files in a package:
	`rpm -qd audit`

5. list only the configuration files in a package:
	`rpm -qc cups`

6. identify which package owns the specified file:
	`rpm -qf /etc/passwd`

7. display information about an installed package including version, release, installation status, installation date, size, signatures, description, and so on:
	`rpm -qi setup`

8. list all file and package dependencies for a given package:
	`rpm -qR chrony`

9. query an installable package for metadata information (version, release, architecture, description, size, signatures, etc.):
	`rpm -qip /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm`

10. determine what packages require the specified package in order to operate properly:
	`rpm -q --whatrequires lvm2`


### Lab: Installing a Package (RPM)
1. Install zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm
`sudo rpm -ivh /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm`

`sudo rpm -ivh --replacepkgs /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64`

### Lab: Removing a Package
1. Remove sushi
`sudo rpm sushi -ve`
### Lab: Extracting Files from an Installable Package
1. You have lost /etc/crony.conf. Determine what package this file comes from:
`rpm -qf /etc/chrony.conf`

2. Extract all files from the crony package to /tmp and create the directory structure:
```bash
[root@server30 mnt]# cd /tmp

[sudo rpm2cpio /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/chrony-3.3-3.el8.x86_64.rpm | cpio -imd
1066 blocks](<[root@server30 tmp]# rpm2cpio /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/chrony-4.3-1.el9.x86_64.rpm | cpio -imd
1253 blocks>)
```

3. Use find to locate the crony.conf file:
`sudo find . -name chrony.conf`

4. Copy the file to /etc:


### Lab: Validating Package Integrity and Credibility
1. Check the integrity of zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm located in /mnt/BaseOS/Packages:
`rpm -K /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm --nosignature`
2. Import the GPG key from the proper file and verify the signature for the zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm package. 
```
sudo rpmkeys --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
sudo rpmkeys -K /mnt/BaseOS/Packages/zsh-5.5.1-6.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

### Lab: Viewing GPG Keys
1. List the imported key: 
`rpm -q gpg-pubkey`
2. View details for the first key:
`rpm -qi gpg-pubkey-fd431d51-4ae0493b`

### Lab: Verifying Package Attributes
1. Run a check on the at program:
`sudo rpm -V at`

2. Change permissions of one of the files and run the check again:
```bash
ls -l /etc/sysconfig/atd
sudo chmod -v 770 /etc/sysconfig/atd
sudo rpm -V at
```

3. Run the check directly on the file:
`sudo rpm -Vf /etc/sysconfig/atd`

4. Reset the value and check the file again:
```bash
sudo chmod -v 644 /etc/sysconfig/atd
sudo rpm -V at
```



### Lab: Perform Package Management Using rpm
1. Run the `ls` command on the /mnt/AppStream/Packages directory to confirm that the rmt package is available:
```bash
