### Welcome to Linux Reader!

Read about random Linux topics and improve your Linux skills!

I'm David,

I am a tech enthusiast interested in Linux, open source projects, networking, scripting, programming, and cyber security. This is my hub where I will be teaching as I learn. This will help me pick up skills better and hopefully help others along the way.

Check out what I am doing [Now](now) or see what I've been [reading](../../booknotes/_index.md).
