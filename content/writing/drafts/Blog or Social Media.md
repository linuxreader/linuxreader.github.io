I've spent a lot of time tinkering with my website. This is a project that has been a huge time suck for me. I don't expect amazing traffic on a personal blog. So I started wondering why I have been spending all of this time building a website.

  

We need to know when to quit things that are taking up time and have no real purpose. That is why I am going to be deleting my site and focusing my efforts on writing on LinkedIn.

  

There are benefits to having a website. It's something you own if you do it right. It's a place you can do whatever you want, and you will never be told what to do or how to post. It's also a place to share what you are working on.

  

BUT... A big thing for me is helping people learn. I like helping others and teaching is a great way to wrap up your learning on a particular topic. The problem is that if nobody sees what you are doing then you are not helping anyone.

  

It feels good to lurk in the shadows and separate yourself from social media. But you need to be happy in any situation and I think writing on LinkedIn is the way I can provide the most value with the type of things I want to teach. Mainly Linux, Networking, Python, and Cyber Security.

  

I do have my issues with LinkedIn as a company and a platform. But you have to pick your battles.
