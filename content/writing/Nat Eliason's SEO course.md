## Things I learned for Nat Eliason's SEO Course

Leveling up
- Start with an easy keyword
- Over time, adjust article for harder and harder keywords
- Long tail keywords with low competition
- Can change meta title for google to the harder keyword later
- Can only change the meta title unless there is something the content is missing that the broader keyword asks for. 
- At first, pick something under 5,000 searches

You don't need to spend time building backlinks. 
You can rank for keywords that aren't even IN your articles. You don't need to focus on keyword density. Focus on intent. 

Google analytics and keyword planner are all that's needed. They are completely free. 

### How to think about SEO

Google is for answering people's questions
Google knows more that SEO experts about how Google works
Any ranking trick will be fixed

Your goal: Answer questions better than anyone else on the internet. 

Step 1: Topic Research
Step 2: Keyword research
Step 3: Writing Content that Ranks
Step 4: Promoting Content
Step 5: Increasing Ranking in the Future

### Topic Research

Is this something people are searching for?
If Yes -> Existing Topic
If No -> New Topic

### Existing Topics
- High SEO Potential
- High SEO Competition
* Make sure to look at your rankings in incognito mode or it will show you searches based on your own browsing history.
* You can rank on words with high competition.

### New Topics
- Something people aren't searching for.
- Lower SEO Potential
- Low SEO Competition
- Make up a term or word to describe what you are talking about. 
- (Examples: savable income, second degree dinners, stamena, etc.)
- Keyword research not neccesary 

## Keyword Research
Step 1: Come up with addressable keywords
Step 2: Assess their keyword volume
Step 3: Assess the competition
Step 4: Pick your keyword
### Step 1: Come up with addressable keywords
Organize information in a spreadsheet. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XitO95OO6q3djdnOZpESaaK9xVcGKGv791mAL3IuRl0/edit?pli=1&gid=0#gid=0

List Possible keywords
Subjectively rate how broad the keyword is

### Step 2: Assess their keyword volume
Use Google keyword planner to add the search volume to the spreadsheet.
View the recommended options and add relevant Keywords to your list.

### Step 3: Assess the competition
New sites will be hard to rank for higher competition keywords.
Ignore competition rating in Google keyword planner.
Search for the keyword in Google
Rank the competition in your spreadsheet based on the top sites that show up. 
Is there an article that directly addresses the question?
If you see a lot of social media results that means there is a good chance it's a low competition keyword. 

### Step 4: Pick your keyword
Don't go after the hard keywords at first. Use the leveling up strategy to go for harder keywords. 
Set meta title tag for title in google
You can level up just by changing the meta title, On adjust the content if the keyword calls for it
Start with easy, more narrow, less competition keyword.
Can level up to harder keywords multiple times after they are ranking
