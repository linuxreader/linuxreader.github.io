Just as good as Starrett's other books. I would argue better if you really want to narrow down your focus to essential movement patterns. Could have been better and Kelly sometimes uses weird analogy's that don't make sense. Like the potato chip thing in his videos. Definitely one to keep coming back to to make sure you are doing these 10 things to keep you moving.
