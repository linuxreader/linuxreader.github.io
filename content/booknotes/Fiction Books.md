Separate page to keep track of Fiction books. Exploring the idea of "Transformative Literature" so I only recently started reading more fiction.

I loved this book. Romeo-and-Juliet-like love story.

Super confusing but brilliant. The writing alone with have you thinking thoughts you didn't know you were capable of.

Quick read. Grapples with the concept of dying and thinking about the things that you thought were important, but really weren't. Easy to read and great writing.
