I’ve been commenting a lot about this device lately, it’s slow out of the box and should work smoothly without having to run through settings; but you know how it goes. Make hardware for a device that would work well and then hold it down with bloatware and make the device miserable to use.

At first I just downloaded nova as a Home Screen replacement, this gave me access to the full android settings where I could turn off google sync, disable apps, pause and optimize them from running in the background and it was in a much better state from there.

I went overkill recently while bored and just deleted some apps through adb on my laptop, I only need this device to read google play books and sync progress across my devices,I play chess on it here and there and it’s a really cool device.

You should use Simple Ink Launcher + Arcticons Black, it's more e-ink friendly compare to Nova.

Also do you observe the longer "innitial refresh" when turn on the device? I used to own a Poke 5S and disable the naviball make it much longer than normal
