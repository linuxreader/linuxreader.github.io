Be aware of the timer for the exam

Each task has a revisit and done button for you reference. The exam system does not take these into account.

Click activities > terminal to bring up a new terminal. You ssh into the lab vms from there. 

For vm manager activities > vm manager

Ip addresses are located in config information

Can also open a console from VM manager

From vm manager, you can select "Rebuild node # vm" to erase and reset the vm.

Try not to use keyboard shortcuts, as it may not behave well in the environment. 

Can open chat icon to take a break. Exam timer is still running during break. May have to perform room scan when you start back up. 

Contact proctor if you need help.
