## Local User Authentication Files
- Three supported account types: root, normal, service
- root 
	- has full access to all services and administrative functions on the system.
	- created by default during installation.
- Normal
	- user-level privileges
	- cannot perform any administrative functions
	- can run applications and programs that have been authorized.
- Service
	- take care of their respective services, which include apache, ftp, mail, and chrony.
- User account information for local users is stored in four files that are located in the /etc directory.
	- passwd, shadow, group, and gshadow (user authentication files)
	 - updated when a user or group account is created, modified, or deleted.
	 - referenced to check and validate the credentials for a user at the time of their login attempt,
	 - system creates their automatic backups by default as passwd-, shadow-, group-, and gshadow- in the /etc directory.
### /etc/passwd
- vital user login data
- each row hold info for one user 
- 644 permissions by default
- 7 feilds per row
	- login name
		- up to 255 characters
		- _ and - characters are supported
		- not recommended to include special characters and uppercase letters in login names.
	- password
		- "x" in this field points to /etc/shadow for actual password.
		- "\*" identifies disabled account
		- Can also include a hashed password (RHEL uses SHA-512 by default)
	- UID
		- Number between 0 and 4.2 billion
		- UID 0 is reserved for root account
		- UIDs 1-200 are used by Red Hat for core service accounts
		- UIDs 201-999 are reserved for non-core service accounts
		- UIDs 1000 < are for normal user accounts (starts at 1000 by default)
	- GID
		- GID that matches entry in /etc/group (primary group)
		- Group for every user by default that matches UID
	- Comments (GECOS) or (GCOS)
		- general comments about the user
	- Home Directory
		- absolute path to the user home directory.
	- Shell
		- absolute path of the shell file for the user's primary shell after logging in. (default = (/bin/bash))

### /etc/shadow
- no access permissions for any user (even root) (but owned by root)
- secure password control (shadow password)
- user passwords are hashed and stored in a more secure file /etc/shadow
- limits on user passwords in terms of expiration, warning period, etc. applied on per-user basis
- limits and other settings are defined in /etc/login.defs
- user is initially checked in the passwd file for existence and then in the shadow file for authenticity.
- contains user authentication and password aging information. 
- Each row in the file corresponds to one entry in the passwd file. 
- login names are used as a common key between the shadow and passwd files.
- nine colon-separated fields per line entry.
	- 1 Login name
	- 2 Encrypted password
		- ! at the beginning of this field shows that the user account is locked
		- if field is empty then user has passwordless entry
	- 3 last change
		- Number of days (lastchg) since the UNIX epoch, (UNIX time (January 01, 1970 00:00:00 UTC) when the password was last modified. 
		- Empty field represents the passiveness of password aging features.
		- 0 forces the user to change their password upon next login.
	- 4 minimum 
		- number of days (mindays) that must elapse before the user is allowed to change their password
		- can be altered using the `chage` command with the `-m` option or the `passwd` command with the `-n` option. 
		- 0 or null in this field disables this feature.
	- 5 (Maximum)
		- maximum number of days (maxdays) before the user password expires and must be changed. 
		- may be altered using the `chage` command with the `-M `option or the `passwd` command with the `-x` option. 
		- null value here disables this feature along with other features such as the maximum password age, warning alerts, and the user inactivity period.
	- 6 Field 6 (Warning)
		- number of days (warndays) the user gets warnings for changing their password before it expires.
		- may be altered using the `chage` command with the `-W` option or the `passwd` command with the `-w` option. 
		- 0 or null in this field disables this feature.
	- 7 Password Expiry)
		 - maximum allowable number of days for the user to be able to log in with the expired password. (inactivity period).
		 - may be altered using the `chage` command with the `-I` option or the `passwd` command with the `-i` option. 
		 - empty field disables this feature. 
	- 8 (Account Expiry) 
		- number of days since the UNIX time when the user account will expire and no longer be available. 
		- may be altered using the chage command with the `-E` option. 
		- empty field disables this feature. 
	- 9 (Reserved): Reserved for future use.

### /etc/group
- plaintext file and contains critical group information. 
- 644 permissions by default and owned by root.
- Each row in the file stores information for one group entry. 
- Every user on the system must be a member of at least one group (User Private Group (UPG)). 
- a group name matches the username it is associated with by default
- four colon-separated fields per line entry.
	- Field 1 (Group Name): 
		- Holds a group name that must begin with a letter. Group names with up to 255 characters, including the 
		- uppercase, underscore (\_) and hyphen (-) characters, are also supported. (not recommended)
	 - Field 2 (Encrypted Password): 
		 - Can be empty or contain an “x” (points to the /etc/gshadow file for the actual password), or a hashed group-level password. 
		 - can set a password on a group for non-members to be able to change their group identity temporarily using the `newgrp `command.
		 - non-members must enter the correct password in order to do so. 
	- Field 3 (GID): 
		- Holds a GID, that is also placed in the GID field of the passwd file. 
		- By default, groups are created with GIDs starting at 1000 and with the same name as the username.  
		- system allows several users to belong to a single group
		- also allows a single user to be a member of multiple groups at the same time. 
	- Field 4 (Group Members): 
		- Lists the membership for the group. (user’s primary group is always defined in the GID field of the passwd file.)



### /etc/gshadow
- no access permissions for any user (even root)
- group passwords are hashed and stored
- group names are used as a common key between the gshadow and group files.
- 000 permissions and owned by root
- four colon-separated fields
	- Field 1 (Group Name): 
		- Consists of a group name as appeared in the group file. 
	- Field 2 (Encrypted Password): 
		- Can contain a hashed password, which may be set with the gpasswd command for non-group members to access the group temporarily using the `newgrp` command. 
		- single exclamation mark (!) or a null value in this field allows group members password-less access and restricts non-members from switching into this group. 
	- Field 3 (Group Administrators): 
		- Lists usernames of group administrators that are authorized to add or remove members with the gpasswd command. 
	- Field 4 (Members): 
		- comma-separated list of members.
### `gpasswd` command:
- add group administrators.
- add or delete group members.
	- assign or revoke a group-level password.
	- disable the ability of the newgrp command to access a group. 
	- picks up the default values from the /etc/login.defs file.

### useradd and login.defs configuration files
### `useradd` command
- picks up the default values from the /etc/default/useradd and /etc/login.defs files for any options that are not specified at the command line when executing it.
- login.defs file is also consulted by the usermod, userdel, chage, and passwd commands 
- Both files store several defaults including those that affect the password length and password lifecycle.
/etc/default/useradd Default Directives:
- starting GID (GROUP) (provided the USERGROUPS_ENAB directive in the login.defs file is set to no)
- home directory location (HOME)
- number of inactivity days between password expiry and permanent account disablement (INACTIVE) 
- account expiry date (EXPIRE), 
- login shell (SHELL), 
- skeleton directory location to copy user initialization files from (SKEL)

## Password Aging attributes
- Can be done for an individual user or applied to all users.
- Can prevent users from logging in to the system by locking their access for a period of time or permanently.
- Must be performed by a user with elevated privileges of the root user.
- Normal users may be allowed access to privileged commands by defining them appropriately in a configuration file.
- Each file that exists on the system regardless of its type has an owning user and an owning group.  
- every file that a user creates is in the ownership of that user. 
- ownership may be changed and given to another user by a super user.

### Password Aging and management
- Setting restrictions on password expiry, account disablement, locking and unlocking users, and password change frequency.
- Can choose to inactivate it completely for an individual user.
- Stored in the /etc/shadow file (fields 4 to 8) and its default policies in the /etc/login.defs configuration file.
- aging management tools—`chage` and `passwd`—
- `usermod` command can be used to implement two aging attributes (user expiry and password expiry) and lock and unlock user accounts.

### chage command
- Set or alter password aging parameters on a user account.
- Changes various fields in the shadow file
- Switches
	- -d (--lastday) 
		- Specifies an explicit date in the YYYY-MM-DD format, or the number of days since the UNIX time when the password was last modified. With -d 0, the user is forced to change the password at next login. It corresponds to field 3 in the shadow file. 
	- -E (--expiredate) 
		- Sets an explicit date in the YYYY-MM-DD format, or the number of days since the UNIX time on which the user account is deactivated. This feature can be disabled with -E -1. It corresponds to the eighth field in the shadow file. 
	- -I (--inactive) 
		- Defines the number of days of inactivity after the password expiry and before the account is locked. The user may be able to log in during this period with their expired password. This feature can be disabled with -I -1. It corresponds to field 7 in the shadow file. 
	- -l 
		- Lists password aging attributes set on a user account. 
	- -m (--mindays)

		- Denotes the maximum number of days of password validity before the user password expires and it must be changed. This feature can be disabled with -M -1. It corresponds to field 5 in the shadow file. 
	- -W (--warndays) 
		- Designates the number of days for which the user gets alerts to change their password before it expires. It corresponds to field 6 in the shadow file.

### passwd command
- set or modify a user’s password

## Linux Groups and their Management
- /etc/group
	- group info
- /etc/login.defs
	- default policies
- /etc/gshadow
	- group administrator information and group-level passwords
- group management tools
	- `groupadd`, `groupmod`, and `groupdel`
	- create, alter, and erase groups

### groupadd command
- adds entries to the group and gshadow files for each group added to the system
- picks up default values from /etc/login.defs
- Switches
	- -g (--gid) 
		- Specifies the GID to be assigned to the group 
	- -o (--non-unique) 
		- Creates a group with a matching GID of an existing group. When two groups have an identical GID, members of both groups get identical rights on each other’s files. This should only be done in specific situations. 
	- -r 
		- Creates a system group with a GID below 1000 
	- groupname 
		- Specifies a group name

### groupmod command
- syntax of this command is very similar to the groupadd with most options identical.
- Additional flags
	- -n
		- change name of existing group

## User Management

### Switching Users

#### su command
Ctrl-d
	- return to previous user
su -
	- switch user with startup scripts
-c 
	- issue a command as a user without switching to them.
- root user can switch into any user account that exists on the system without being prompted for that user’s password.
- switching into the root account to execute privileged actions is not recommended.

### whoami command
- show current user
### logname command
- Identity of the user who originally logged in.
### groupdel command
- removes entries for the specified group from both group and gshadow files.

### Doing as Superuser (substitute user)
- Any normal user that requires privileged access to administrative commands or non-owning files is defined in the sudoers file.
	- File may be edited with a command called `visudo`
	- Creates a copy of the file as sudoers.tmp and applies the changes there. After the visudo session is over, the updated updated file overwrites the original sudoers file and sudoers.tmp is deleted.
	- syntax
		- user1 ALL=(ALL) ALL
		- %dba ALL=(ALL) ALL
			group is prefixed by %
	- Make it so members are not prompted for password
		- user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
		- %dba ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
	- Limit access to a single command
		- user1 ALL=/usr/bin/cat
		- %dba ALL=/usr/bin/cat
- too many entries can clutter sudoers file. Use aliases instead:
	- User_Alias
		- you can define a User_Alias called PKGADM for user1, user100, and user200. These users may or may not belong to the same Linux group.
	- Cmnd_Alias
		- you can define a Cmnd_Alias called PKGCMD containing yum and rpm package management commands
### sudo command
- /etc/sudoers
- /etc/sudoers.d/
	- drop-in directory
/var/log/secure
	- Sudo logs successful authentication and command data to here under the name of the user using the command.
### Owning User and Owning Group
- Every file and directory has an owner.
- Creator assumes ownership by default.
- Every user is a member of one or more groups.
- Owners group is also assigned to file or directory by default.

### chown command
- alter the ownership for files and directories
- Must have root privileges.
- Can also change owning group.
### chgrp command
- alter the owning group for files and directories
- Must have root privileges.

## Advanced User Management Labs
