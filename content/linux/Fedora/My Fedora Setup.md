When you first download Fedora Workstation, it's going to be a little hard to figure out how to make it usable. Especially if you've never tinkered with Linux before.

This is because Fedora with Gnome desktop is a blank canvas. The point is to let you customize it to your needs. When I first install Fedora, I pull my justfile to install most of the programs I use:

	`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxreader/dotfiles/main/dot_justfile >> ~/.justfile`

## Install just and run the justfile

To run the just file, I then install the just program and run it on the justfile:

`dnf install just`

`just ~/.justfile`

This is my current .justfile:
```bash
first-install:
# Install flatpacks

    source ~/.bashrc
    gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"
```

## Install Homebrew Stuff:

then run `just homebrew` after a reboot to install packages with brew

```bash
homebrew:
    brew install \
      chezmoi \
      onedrive \
      hugo \
      virt-manager
```

## Virt Manager
```bash
sudo dnf install @virtualization
```

```bash
sudo vi /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf
```

Uncomment the line: `unix_sock_group = "libvirt"`

Adjust the UNIX socket permissions for the R/W socket:
`unix_sock_rw_perms = "0770"`

Start the service:
`systemctl enable --now libvirtd`

Add user to group:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami) && sudo usermod -a -G kvm $(whoami)
```

## Configure Howdy 
Howdy is a tool for using an IR webcam for authentication:
```bash
sudo dnf copr enable principis/howdy
sudo dnf --refresh install -y howdy
```

https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/principis/howdy/
https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy

## Seahorse
I was using this to fix the Login Keyring error that is common with Fedora, but it no longer works.
`sudo dnf -y install seahorse && seahorse`

Applications > Passwords and Keys > Passwords > Right-click Login > Change Password to blank.

## Initialize Chezmoi
Chezmoi let's you easy sync your dotfiles with Github and your other computers. Just init Chezmoi and add your Github username. This assumes your dotfiles in Github are saved in the proper format. 
`chezmoi init --apply linuxreader

## Add badname user (if needed)
If you need to use username with the format `firstname.lastname`, use the `badname` flag with the `adduser` command. You will have to create a normal user first, because you can't do this during the initial install:
`$ adduser --badname firstname.lastname`
`$ sudo usermod -aG wheel username`

```
# uncomment this line in the visudo file 
$ sudo visudo
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

Delete the other user:
`$ userdel username`

## Additional DNF stuff:
Clear cache (do this occasionally):
`sudo dnf clean dbcache`
or `sudo dnf clean all`

Update DNF:
`sudo dnf -y update`

Additional DNF commands:
[https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/package-management/DNF/](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/package-management/DNF/ "https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/package-management/DNF/")

## Set up RPM Fusion
RPM Fusion give you more accessibility to various software packages.

Install:
```
sudo dnf -y install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```

[https://rpmfusion.org/](https://rpmfusion.org/ "https://rpmfusion.org/")
## AppStream metadata
Use AppStream to enable users to install packages using Gnome Software/KDE Discover:
```
sudo dnf -y groupupdate core
```

## Flatpaks
To enable Flatpaks (this may no longer be needed:
```
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

https://flatpak.org/setup/Fedora
## Set a hostname
Set a hostname for the system. This will show after next reboot:
`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "New_Custom_Name"`


## Other Stuff
Here is some other stuff I install from the software center.

### Input Leap
Input Leap let's you share a mouse and keyboard between two workstations.

![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020240905105932.png)

I don't know what this is or why it is here:
installing Git and a bunch of other stuff?
```bash
sudo dnf install git cmake make gcc-c++ xorg-x11-server-devel \
                 libcurl-devel avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel \
                 libXtst-devel qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel  \
                 qt5-qttools-devel libICE-devel libSM-devel \
                 openssl-devel libXrandr-devel libXinerama-devel
```

## Virtual machine Manager
The best way to manage VMs on desktop.

And some extensions installed through Extension Manager:
![](/images/Pasted%20image%2020240905105517.png)

Install Gnome Screenshot tool:

Install the extention:
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1112/screenshot-tool/

You also need to install from DNF for some reason:
`dnf install -y gnome-screenshot`

## Airpods not pairing Issue
If you ever have the issue where Airpods won't pair. Remove them from the pairing list, force them in pairing mode, and pair them back. This can be made easy with bluetoothctl:

Just in case, restart the bluetooth service:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart bluetooth
systemctl status bluetooth 
```

Show devices:
```
# bluetoothctl

[bluetooth] $ devices
Device 42:42:42:42:42:42 My AirPods <-- grab the name here
[bluetooth] $ remove 42:42:42:42:42:42 
```

Now, make sure your Airpods are in the charging case, close the lid, wait 15 seconds, then open the lid. Press and hold the setup button on the case for up to 10 seconds. The status light should flash white, which means that your Airpods are ready to connect.

Pair them back:
```
[bluetooth] $ pair 42:42:42:42:42:42
```

## Enable Fractional Scaling
This lets you change display scaling in smaller increments. You'll need to make sure Wayland is turned on.

Turn on the feature then reboot:
`gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['scale-monitor-framebuffer']"`

`reboot`

## Remove pasted characters ^[](200~')
Kept having pasted format characters ^[](200~') mess up my groove. Here's the fix.

Open your inputrc file and add the line below:
`vim ~/.inputrc`

```bash
"\C-v": ""
```

## Install gimp
`sudo dnf install gimp`
enable in screenshot tool after install for gimp {f}

Install Arrows
https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/44797/how-do-i-insert-arrows-into-a-picture-in-gimp

```
Go to your home folder
Go to .config/GIMP
Go to the folder with a version number (2.10 for me)
Go to scripts
Download the arrow.scm file and place it here. Don't forget to unzip.
Open GIMP and draw a path
```

From Tools menu, select Arrow
