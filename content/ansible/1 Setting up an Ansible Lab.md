## Requirements for Ansible
- Python 3 on control node and managed nodes
- sudo ssh access to managed nodes
- Ansible installed on the Control node
## Lab Setup
For this lab, we will need three virtual machines using RHEL 9. 1 control node and 2 managed nodes. Use IP addresses based on your lab network environment:

| Hostname             | pretty hostname | ip addreess     | RAM    | Storage | vCPUs |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| control.example.com  | control         | 192.168.124.200 | 2048MB | 20G     | 2     |
| ansible1.example.com | ansible1        | 192.168.124.201 | 2048MB | 20G     | 2     |
| ansible2.example.com | ansible2        | 192.168.124.202 | 2048MB | 20G     | 2     |
I have set these VMs up in virt-manager, then cloned them so I can rebuild the lab later. You can automate this using Vagrant or Ansible but that will come later. Ignore the Win10 VM. It's a necessary evil:

### Setting hostnames and verifying dependencies

Set a hostname on all three machines:
```bash
[root@localhost ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname control.example.com
[root@localhost ~]# hostnamectl set-hostname --pretty control
```

Install Ansible on Control Node
```bash
[root@localhost ~]# dnf -y install ansible-core
...
```

Verify python3 is installed:
```bash
[root@localhost ~]# python --version
Python 3.9.18
```

### Configure Ansible user and SSH 

Add a user for Ansible. This can be any username you like, but we will use "ansible" as our lab user. Also, the ansible user needs sudo access.  We will also make it so no password is required for convenience. You will need to do this on the control node and both managed nodes:
```bash
[root@control ~]# useradd ansible
[root@control ~]# visudo
```

Add this line to the file that comes up:
`ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`

Configure a password for the ansible user:
```bash
[root@control ~]# passwd ansible
Changing password for user ansible.
New password: 
BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters
Retype new password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
```

On the control node only: Add host names of the nodes to /etc/hosts:
```bash
echo "192.168.124.201 ansible1 >> /etc/hosts
> ^C
[root@control ~]# echo "192.168.124.201 ansible1" >> /etc/hosts
[root@control ~]# echo "192.168.124.202 ansible2" >> /etc/hosts
[root@control ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
192.168.124.201 ansible1
192.168.124.202 ansible2
```

Log in to the ansible user account for the remaining steps. Note, Ansible assumes passwordless (key-based) login for ssh. If you insist on using passwords, add the --ask-pass (-k) flag to your Ansible commands. (This may require sshpass package to work)

On the control node only:  Generate an ssh key to send to the hosts for passwordless Login:
```bash
[ansible@control ~]$ ssh-keygen -N "" -q
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa): 
```

Copy the public key to the nodes and test passwordless access and test passwordless login to the managed nodes:
```bash

^C[ansible@control ~]$ ssh-copy-id ansible@ansible1
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

Install lab stuff from the RHCE guide:
`sudo dnf -y install git`

```bash
[ansible@control base]$ cd

[ansible@control ~]$ git clone https://github.com/sandervanvugt/rhce8-book
