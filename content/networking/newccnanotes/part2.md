Comparing Dynamic Routing Protocol Features
Routers add IP routes to their routing tables using routes, and routes learned by using dynamic routing protocols.three methods: connected routes, static
Routing protocol:overall purpose of learning routes. This process includesA set of messages, rules, and algorithms used by routers for the the exchange and analysis of
routing information. Each router chooses the best route to each subnet (path selection) and finally places those best routes in its IP routing table. Examples include RIP, EIGRP,
OSPF, and BGP.

Routing Protocol Functions
Learn routing information about IP subnets from neighboring routers.
Advertise routing information about IP subnets to neighboring routers.
If more than one possible route exists to reach one subnet, pick the best route based on a
metric.
