This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derek Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Career

I am currently a Linux System Administrator. I just passed the RHCSA exam today! Check out my [RHCSA Notes](../redhat/RHCSA%20Notes.md). Not sure what I'm going to learn next. May just play around in Linux for a while. 

## Personal

Now that I have finished my RHCSA goal.  I am focusing more on heath. Primary goal is to quit caffeine by the end of Q1.

## Things to Learn

I keep a page of projects that I want to do and tech that I want to learn [here.](Projects.md) Then, instead of trying to learn every new shiny thing as it pops up. I continue to focus on my current goal.
