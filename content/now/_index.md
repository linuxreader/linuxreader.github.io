This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derek Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Things to Learn

I keep a page of projects that I want to do and tech that I want to learn [here.](Projects.md) Then, instead of trying to learn every new shiny thing as it pops up. I continue to focus on my current goal.

- B12
- Kelp (for Iodine)
- D3

- If you introduce more than one new movement at a time you have no clue what triggered your pain.
