The lesson11-lab.yaml playbook contains some errors. Fix them according
to the following instructions:

• Use command-line tools and arguments to find the errors. Don't fix
them by just reading the YAML file, even if some errors are obvious.

• After fixing an error in one task, start running the playbook with the
next task. Try to avoid running the same task over and over again.

• Before applying the template, use a dry-run and a diff to see what the
template will change.

• Use the debug module where necessary.
