There are a bunch of reasons. 

I like the restrictions that physical books place on me: 
- I can't read them all the time (forces me to be alone with my thoughts more), 
- Can't highlight too many things, 
- Can't download 1,000s of books and jump back and fourth between books (I only own one book that I haven't read at a time, this helps me focus on one thing). 

And the things I like about them: 
- I own them, 
- No one can edit or change them without my consent, 
- I have a physical library that my kids can look at, 
- My kids can see that I am reading a book when I am reading a book, 
- I can see my reading spot and where highlights are easier (with sticky tabs), 
- I can go browse the books store and meet new people, conversations are started more when people can see what I am reading, 
- I like the asthetic of bookshelves, 
- I get to escape from technology (I work on and tinker with technology all day for work). 
- Format stays consistant.

I get the technological conveniences and perceived benefits, they are just negatives for how I want to live me life. I have done a great deal of thinking about this. 

I do also understand that this way of doing things wouldn't be optimal for everyone. I just find that the simpler I make things and the less I rely on technology, the happier I am. 

If it was good enough for people 2,000 years ago then it's good enough for me now.
