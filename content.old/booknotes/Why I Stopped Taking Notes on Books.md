Whether you are using sticky tabs, highlighters, or pencils to mark your favorite passages from books. Or just swiping your finger to highlight and exporting your highlights. All of this takes time and energy away from reading. 

The only benefit is that you have something to go back to later if you want to review important parts from books. 

But, going back to highlights and reviewing them also takes time. And I would rather just re-read a book that is worth re-reading. 

Now, highlighting books and going deep and really understanding fewer books has its place. But I personally like the novelty of reading more books. 

If you are reading lots of books, chances are there will be overlapping topics and information. 

You can use this overlapping information as your review. This way, you get repetition in without having to do any tedious work.

I have personally spent way too much time taking notes on books. And that took time away from all if the goals that I had. I never set a goal to "take notes on books". My goal was always to read more books. Each book being it's own little goal. 

A solution is to practice using your brain power. If you have a daily practice of talking and writing and helping others, all of the stuff you are reading now will naturally get processed into your creative outlet. Assuming your are talking about and reading about things that interest you.
