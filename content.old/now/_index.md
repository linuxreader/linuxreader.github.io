This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derek Sivers for starting a "Now" page movement. Read about "Now" pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about).

## Career

I am currently a Linux System Administrator. I am studying for Red Hat's RHCSA exam. My goal is to take the test at the end of MArch 2025. Follow my progress here: [RHCSA Study Tracker](RHCSA%20Study%20Tracker.md) 

Also focused on cutting things out of my life that no longer serve me. 

## What I am Reading

## Things to Learn

I keep a page of projects that I want to do and tech that I want to learn [here.](Projects.md) Then, instead of trying to learn every new shiny thing as it pops up. I continue to focus on my current goal. 

## Plans for my website
- [x] Build out basic theme and layout. 
- [x] Add picture to about page.
- [x] Make a "Recommended Reading" page with recommended books, and a picture of the book covers. 
- [x] See if there is a way to change URLs for pages. I would like the URL to match the page name instead of saying "index.html"
- [x] Get a logo created and add it to site. 
- [x] Create a "Contact me" page.
- [x] Change "now" icon.
- [ ] Make a page with all of the tools I use.
- [ ] Make a script that updates website every time I update my markdown files.
- [x] Add comments functionality to pages. (I'm not going to be adding comments to this site)
- [ ] Add a newsletter.
- [ ] Custom avatar.
- [x] Write 20 posts. (20/20)
