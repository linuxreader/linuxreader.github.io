    <link>http://localhost:1313/now/</link>
    <description>This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derek Sivers for starting a “Now” page movement. Read about “Now” pages here.&#xA;Updated: 02-20-2025&#xA;Career I am currently a Linux System Administrator. I just passed the RHCSA exam today! Check out my RHCSA Notes. Not sure what I’m going to learn next. May just play around in Linux for a while.</description>
