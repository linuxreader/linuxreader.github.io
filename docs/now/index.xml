    <title>What I am Doing Now :: Linux Reader</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/now/</link>
    <description>This is a page to help me stay focused and keep track of what I am doing. It is also to show others what I am currently working on and thinking about. Credit goes to Derek Sivers for starting a “Now” page movement. Read about “Now” pages here.&#xA;I keep a page of projects that I want to do and tech that I want to learn here. Then, instead of trying to learn every new shiny thing as it pops up. I continue to focus on my current goal.</description>
