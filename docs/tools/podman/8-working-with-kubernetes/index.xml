While there have been some efforts to use Podman as the container engine for Podman (the kind project supports this), I do not generally recommend that you use Podman for this purpose. I recommend you use CRI-O described in appendix A, since it was built specifically to work with Kubernetes and shares the underlying libraries of Podman. Kubernetes is now discouraging users from using the Docker backend and encouraging them to use a CRI-O or containerd as a backend.</description>
