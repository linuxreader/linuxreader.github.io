    <description>2 Command line This chapter covers:&#xA;The Podman command line Running an OCI application Comparing containers and images Building an OCI-based image Podman is an excellent tool for running and building containerized applications. In this chapter, you’ll get started by building a simple web application to demonstrate commonly used features of the Podman command line.&#xA;If you don’t have Podman installed on your machine, you can jump to appendix C, and then return here. This chapter assumes that Podman 4.1 or later is already installed. Older versions of Podman probably work fine, but all examples were tested with Podman 4.1.</description>
