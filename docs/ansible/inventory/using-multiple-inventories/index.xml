    <description>Working with Multiple Inventory Files Ansible supports working with multiple inventory files. One way of using multiple inventory files is to enter multiple -i parameters with the ansible or ansible-playbook commands to specify the name of the files to be used. ansible-inventory -i inventory -i listing101.py --list Would produce an output list based on the static inventory in the inventory file, as well as the dynamic inventory that is generated by the listing101.py Python script. You can also specify the name of a directory using the -i option. Uses all files in the directory as inventory files. When using an inventory directory, dynamic inventory files still must be executable for this approach to work. Lab: Using Multiple Inventories Open a shell as the ansible user and create a directory with the name inventories. Copy the file listing101.py to the directory inventories. Also copy the inventory file to the directory inventories. To make sure both inventories have some unique contents, add the following lines to the file inventories/inventory: webserver1 webserver2 Add the following lines to the Linux /etc/hosts file: 192.168.4.203 ansible3.example.com ansible3 192.168.4.204 ansible4.example.com ansible4 Use the command ansible-inventory -i inventories --list.</description>
