    <description>12 Managing Software with Ansible Implementing a Playbook to Manage Software In the previous sections you learned how to use different modules to manage software. In this section you apply this knowledge in a more advanced playbook example. You’ll also find an advanced example like this in Chapters 13 through 15 so that you get the best possible preparation for the EX294 exam. To match the exam style of questions, the example is scenario based, and the assignment is formatted as a step-by-step exercise. As is the case for all exercises, the complete playbook discussed here is available in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/sandervanvugt/rhce8-book/exercise123.yaml.</description>
