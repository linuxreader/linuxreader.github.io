    <description>Managing Ansible Errors and Logs Using Check Mode Before actually running a playbook in a way that all changes are implemented, you can start the playbooks in check mode. To do this, you use the --check or -C command-line argument to the ansible or ansible-playbook command. The effect of using check mode is that changes that would have been made are shown but not executed. You should realize, though, that check mode is not supported in all cases. You will, for instance, have problems with check mode if it is applied to conditionals, where a specific task can do its work only after a preceding task has made some changes. Also, to successfully use check mode, the modules need to support it, but some don’t. Modules that don’t support check mode don’t show any result while running check mode, but also they don’t make any changes.</description>
