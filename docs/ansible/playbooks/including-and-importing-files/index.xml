    <description>When content is included, it is dynamically processed at the moment that Ansible reaches that content.&#xA;If content is imported, Ansible performs the import operation before starting to work on the tasks in the playbook. Files can be included and imported at different levels:&#xA;• Roles: Roles are typically used to process a complete set of instructions provided by the role. Roles have a specific structure as well.&#xA;• Playbooks: Playbooks can be imported as a complete playbook. You cannot do this from within a play. Playbooks can be imported only at the top level of the playbook.</description>
