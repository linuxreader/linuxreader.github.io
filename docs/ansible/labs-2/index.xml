    <description>Managing Users Advanced Scenario Exercise It’s time to work on an advanced scenario now. Exercise 13-4 includes a step-by-step procedure that guides you through the process of setting up a complex playbook. In this procedure I tried to give you practical guidelines on how to approach such a complex task on the exam, including the part where you may change your mind because you have realized there is a more efficient method. It is important to read the steps carefully because some improvements will be applied while working on this procedure.</description>
