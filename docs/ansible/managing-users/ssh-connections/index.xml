    <description>Managing SSH Connections How to provide for SSH keys for new users in such a way that users are provided with SSH keys without having to set them up themselves. To do this, you use the authorized_key module together with the generate_ssh_key argument to the user module. Understanding SSH Connection Management Requirements How SSH keys are used in the communication process between a user and an SSH server:&#xA;The user initiates a session with an SSH server. The server sends back an identification token that is encrypted with the server private key to the user. The user uses the server’s public key fingerprint, which is stored in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file to verify the identification token. If no public key fingerprint was stored yet in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, the user is prompted to store the remote server identity in the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. At this point there is no good way to verify whether the user is indeed communicating with the intended server. After establishing the identity of the remote server, the user can either send over a password or generate an authentication token that is based on the user’s private key. If an authentication token that was based on the user’s private key is sent over, this token is received by the server, which tries to match it against the user’s public key that is stored in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. After the incoming authentication token to the stored user public key in the authorized_keys file is matched, the user is authenticated. If this authentication fails and password authentication is allowed, password authentication is attempted next. In the authentication procedure, two key pairs play an important role. First, there is the server’s public/private key pair, which is used to establish a secure connection. To manage the host public key, you can use the Ansible known_hosts module. Next, there is the user’s public/private key pair, which the user uses to authenticate. To manage the public key in this key pair, you can use the Ansible authorized_key module.</description>
