    <description>Ad hoc commands are ansible tasks you can run against managed hosts without the need of a playbook or script. These are used for bringing nodes to their desired states, verifying playbook results, and verifying nodes meet any needed criteria/pre-requisites. These must be ran as the ansible user (whatever your remote_user directive is set to under [defaults] in ansible.cfg)&#xA;Run the user module with the argument name=lisa on all hosts to make sure the user “lisa” exists. If the user doesn’t exist, it will be created on the remote system: ansible all -m user -a &#34;name=lisa&#34;</description>
