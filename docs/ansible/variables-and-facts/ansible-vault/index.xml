    <description>Ansible Vault For webkeys, passwords, and other types of sensitive data that you really shouldn’t store as plain text in a playbook. Can use Ansible Vault to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data to make it unreadable, and only while accessing data does it ask for a password so that it is decrypted. 1. Sensitive data is stored as values in variables in a separate variable file. 2. The variable file is encrypted, using the ansible-vault command. 3. While accessing the variable file from a playbook, you enter a password to decrypt.</description>
