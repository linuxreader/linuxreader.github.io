<h3 id="chap04.xhtml_leanpub-auto-prototyping-and-testing-with-local-virtual-machines">Prototyping and testing with local virtual machines</h3>
<p>Ansible works well with any server to which you can connect&mdash;remote
<em>or</em> local. For speedier testing and development of Ansible playbooks,
and for testing in general, it&rsquo;s a very good idea to work locally. Local
development and testing of infrastructure is both safer and faster than
doing it on remote/live machines&mdash;especially in production
environments!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the past decade, test-driven development (TDD), in one form or
another, has become the norm for much of the software industry.
Infrastructure development hasn&rsquo;t been as organized until recently, and
best practices dictate that infrastructure (which is becoming more and
more important to the software that runs on it) should be thoroughly
tested as well.</p>
<p>Changes to software are tested either manually or in some automated
fashion; there are now systems that integrate both with Ansible and with
other deployment and configuration management tools, to allow some
amount of infrastructure testing as well. Even if it&rsquo;s just testing a
configuration change locally before applying it to production, that
approach is a thousand times better than what, in the software
development world, would be called &lsquo;cowboy coding&rsquo;&mdash;working directly in
a production environment, not documenting or encapsulating changes in
code, and not having a way to roll back to a previous version.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The past decade has seen the growth of many virtualization tools that
allow for flexible and very powerful infrastructure emulation, all from
your local workstation! It&rsquo;s empowering to be able to play around with a
config file, or to tweak the order of a server update to perfection,
over and over again, with no fear of breaking an important server. If
you use a local virtual machine, there&rsquo;s no downtime for a server
rebuild; just re-run the provisioning on a new VM, and you&rsquo;re back up
and running in minutes&mdash;with no one the wiser.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Vagrant</a>, a server provisioning tool, and
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" rel="external" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a>, a local virtualization
environment, make a potent combination for testing infrastructure and
individual server configurations locally. Both applications are free and
open source, and work well on Mac, Linux, or Windows hosts.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to set up Vagrant and VirtualBox for easy testing with
Ansible to provision a new server.</p>
<h3 id="chap04.xhtml_leanpub-auto-your-first-local-server-setting-up-vagrant">Your first local server: Setting up Vagrant</h3>
<p>To get started with your first local virtual server, you need to
download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox, and set up a simple
Vagrantfile, which will describe the virtual server.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox (whichever version is
appropriate for your OS): - <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html" rel="external" target="_blank">Download
Vagrant</a> - <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" rel="external" target="_blank">Download
VirtualBox</a> (when
installing, make sure the command line tools are installed, so
Vagrant work with it)</li>
<li>Create a new folder somewhere on your hard drive where you will keep
your Vagrantfile and provisioning instructions.</li>
<li>Open a Terminal or PowerShell window, then navigate to the folder
you just created.</li>
<li>Add a CentOS 7.x 64-bit &lsquo;box&rsquo; using the
<a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><code>vagrant box add</code></a>
command: <code>vagrant box add geerlingguy/centos7</code> (note: HashiCorp&rsquo;s
<a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search" rel="external" target="_blank">Atlas</a> has a
comprehensive list of different pre-made Linux boxes. Also, check
out the &lsquo;official&rsquo; Vagrant Ubuntu boxes on the <a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/wiki/Available-Vagrant-Boxes" rel="external" target="_blank">Vagrant
wiki</a>.</li>
<li>Create a default virtual server configuration using the box you just
downloaded: <code>vagrant init geerlingguy/centos7</code></li>
<li>Boot your CentOS server: <code>vagrant up</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Vagrant has downloaded a pre-built 64-bit CentOS 7 virtual machine (you
can <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/virtualbox/boxes.html" rel="external" target="_blank">build your own</a>
virtual machine &lsquo;boxes&rsquo;, if you so desire), loaded it into VirtualBox
with the configuration defined in the default Vagrantfile (which is now
in the folder you created earlier), and booted the virtual machine.</p>
<p>Managing this virtual server is extremely easy: <code>vagrant halt</code> will shut
down the VM, <code>vagrant up</code> will bring it back up, and <code>vagrant destroy</code>
will completely delete the machine from VirtualBox. A simple
<code>vagrant up</code> again will re-create it from the base box you originally
downloaded.</p>
<p>Now that you have a running server, you can use it just like you would
any other server, and you can connect via SSH. To connect, enter
<code>vagrant ssh</code> from the folder where the Vagrantfile is located. If you
want to connect manually, or connect from another application, enter
<code>vagrant ssh-config</code> to get the required SSH details.</p>
<h3 id="chap04.xhtml_leanpub-auto-using-ansible-with-vagrant">Using Ansible with Vagrant</h3>
<p>Vagrant&rsquo;s ability to bring up preconfigured boxes is convenient on its
own, but you could do similar things with the same efficiency using
VirtualBox&rsquo;s (or VMWare&rsquo;s, or Parallels&rsquo;) GUI. Vagrant has some other
tricks up its sleeve:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/networking/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><strong>Network interface
management</strong></a>: You
can forward ports to a VM, share the public network connection, or use
private networking for inter-VM and host-only communication.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/synced-folders/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><strong>Shared folder
management</strong></a>:
Vagrant sets up shares between your host machine and VMs using NFS or
(much slower) native folder sharing in VirtualBox.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/multi-machine/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><strong>Multi-machine
management</strong></a>:
Vagrant is able to configure and control multiple VMs within one
Vagrantfile. This is important because, as stated in the
documentation, &ldquo;Historically, running complex environments was done by
flattening them onto a single machine. The problem with that is that
it is an inaccurate model of the production setup, which behaves far
differently.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/index.html" rel="external" target="_blank"><strong>Provisioning</strong></a>:
When running <code>vagrant up</code> the first time, Vagrant automatically
<em>provisions</em> the newly-minted VM using whatever provisioner you have
configured in the Vagrantfile. You can also run <code>vagrant provision</code>
after the VM has been created to explicitly run the provisioner again.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s this last feature that is most important for us. Ansible is one of
many provisioners integrated with Vagrant (others include basic shell
scripts, Chef, Docker, Puppet, and Salt). When you call
<code>vagrant provision</code> (or <code>vagrant up</code>) the first time, Vagrant passes off
the VM to Ansible, and tells Ansible to run a defined Ansible playbook.
We&rsquo;ll get into the details of Ansible playbooks later, but for now,
we&rsquo;re going to edit our Vagrantfile to use Ansible to provision our
virtual machine.</p>
<p>Open the Vagrantfile that was created when we used the <code>vagrant init</code>
command earlier. Add the following lines just before the final &rsquo;end&rsquo;
(Vagrantfiles use Ruby syntax, in case you&rsquo;re wondering):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is a very basic configuration to get you started using Ansible with
Vagrant. There are <a href="http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/ansible.html" rel="external" target="_blank">many other Ansible
options</a> you can
use once we get deeper into using Ansible. For now, we just want to set
up a very basic playbook&mdash;a simple file you create to tell Ansible how
to configure your VM.</p>
<h3 id="chap04.xhtml_leanpub-auto-your-first-ansible-playbook">Your first Ansible playbook</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s create the Ansible <code>playbook.yml</code> file now. Create an empty text
file in the same folder as your Vagrantfile, and put in the following
contents:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll get into what this playbook is doing in a minute. For now, let&rsquo;s
run the playbook on our VM. Make sure you&rsquo;re in the same directory as
the Vagrantfile and new playbook.yml file, and enter
<code>vagrant provision</code>. You should see status messages for each of the
&rsquo;tasks&rsquo; you defined, and then a recap showing what Ansible did on your
VM&mdash;something like the following:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ansible just took the simple playbook you defined, parsed the YAML
syntax, and ran a bunch of commands via SSH to configure the server as
you specified. Let&rsquo;s go through the playbook, step by step:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This first line is a marker showing that the rest of the document will
be formatted in YAML (read a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/start.html" rel="external" target="_blank">getting started guide for
YAML</a>).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This line tells Ansible to which hosts this playbook applies. <code>all</code>
works here, since Vagrant is invisibly using its own Ansible inventory
file (instead of the one we created earlier in <code>/etc/ansible/hosts</code>),
which just defines the Vagrant VM.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since we need privileged access to install NFS and modify system
configuration, this line tells Ansible to use <code>sudo</code> for all the tasks
in the playbook.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All the tasks after this line will be run on all hosts (or, in our case,
our one VM).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This command is the equivalent of running <code>yum install ntp</code>, but is much
more intelligent; it will check if ntp is installed, and, if not,
install it. This is the equivalent of the following shell script:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, the above script is still not quite as robust as Ansible&rsquo;s
<code>yum</code> command. What if ntpdate is installed, but not ntp? This script
would require extra tweaking and complexity to match the simple Ansible
yum command, especially after we explore the yum module more intimately
(or the <code>apt</code> module, when using Ubuntu and Debian-flavored Linux).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This final task both checks and ensures that the ntpd service is started
and running, and sets it to start at system boot. A shell script with
the same effect would be:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see how things start getting complex in the land of shell
scripts! And this shell script is still not as robust as what you get
with Ansible. To maintain idempotency and handle error conditions,
you&rsquo;ll have to do a lot more extra work with basic shell scripts than
you do with Ansible.</p>
<p>We could be even more terse (and really demonstrate Ansible&rsquo;s powerful
simplicity) and not use Ansible&rsquo;s <code>name</code> module to give human-readable
names to each command, resulting in the following playbook:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Just as with code and configuration files, documentation in Ansible
(e.g. using the <code>name</code> function and/or adding comments to the YAML for
complicated tasks) is not absolutely necessary. However, I&rsquo;m a firm
believer in thorough (but concise) documentation, so I almost always
document what my tasks will do by providing a <code>name</code> for each one. This
also helps when you&rsquo;re running the playbooks, so you can see what&rsquo;s
going on in a human-readable format.</p>

<h3 id="chap04.xhtml_leanpub-auto-summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>Your workstation is on the path to becoming an
&ldquo;infrastructure-in-a-box,&rdquo; and you can now ensure your infrastructure is
as well-tested as the code that runs on top if it. With one small
example, you&rsquo;ve got a glimpse at the simple-yet-powerful Ansible
playbook. We&rsquo;ll dive deeper into Ansible playbooks later, and we&rsquo;ll also
explore Vagrant a little more as we go.</p>
