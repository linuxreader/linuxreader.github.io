    <description>Chapter 10 - Server Security and Ansible The first configuration to be performed on any new server—especially any server with any exposure (direct or indirect) to the public Internet)—is security configuration.&#xA;There are nine basic measures to ensure servers are secure from unauthorized access or intercepted communications:&#xA;Use secure and encrypted communication. Disable root login and use sudo. Remove unused software, open only required ports. Use the principle of least privilege. Update the OS and installed software. Use a properly-configured firewall. Make sure log files are populated and rotated. Monitor logins and block suspect IP addresses. Use SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux). Your infrastructure is as weak as the weakest server; in many high-profile security breaches, one poorly-secured server acts as a gateway into the rest of the network. Don’t let your servers be those servers! Good security also helps you achieve the holy grail of system administration—100% uptime.</description>
