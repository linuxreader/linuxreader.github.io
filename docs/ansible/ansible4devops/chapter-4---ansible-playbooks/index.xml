    <description>Chapter 4 - Ansible Playbooks Power plays Like many other configuration management solutions, Ansible uses a metaphor to describe its configuration files. They are called ‘playbooks’, and they list a set of tasks (‘plays’ in Ansible parlance) that will be run against a particular server or set of servers. In American football, a team follows a set of pre-written playbooks as the basis for a bunch of plays they execute to try to win a game. In Ansible, you write playbooks (a list of instructions describing the steps to bring your server to a certain configuration state) that are then played on your servers.</description>
