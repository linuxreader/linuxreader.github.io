    <description>There are austerities you should avoid all together. Such as any poison to the body. (Drugs, alcohol, caffeine, etc.)Â There may be drugs or chemicals prescribed by a doctor that are life saving. Choose your doctor wisely. Some may do more harm than good.&#xA;Other austerities should be used or enjoyed. But periodically given up. Both as a test of suffering and to open up other doors.&#xA;p</description>
