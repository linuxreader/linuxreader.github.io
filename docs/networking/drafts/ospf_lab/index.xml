    <description>Welcome to the CCNA OSPF lab. Youâ€™ll need to configure OSPF so that there are full routing capabilities in the network. As well as use show commands to verify your network. Then you will troubleshoot and fix a broken OSPF network.&#xA;Once again, this will all be done in Packet Tracer. But feel free to do this lab on real equipment, GNS-3, etc.&#xA;OSPF Setup There are two main ways to configure OSPF. You can go into OSPF configuration mode. Or you can configure OSPF in Interface configuration mode. I will show you how to configure router1. You will need to configure the other routers as well.</description>
