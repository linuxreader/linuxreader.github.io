    <description>VLANs create smaller broadcast domains. Why create smaller broadcast domains?&#xA;Device have to do less stuff (process less broadcasts) Better security Group different departments together Narrow down problems Less spanning tree if you reduce vlan to a single switch 802.1q tagging&#xA;Frames are tagged with an 802.1q header as they leave the switch. So the receiving switch knows what vlan the frame is part of.&#xA;802.1q header&#xA;4 bytes Includes 12 bit vlan id field that supports 4096 vlans. (0 and 5 are reserved so make that 4094) Also include type, priority, and flag fields VLAN numbers and what they mean</description>
