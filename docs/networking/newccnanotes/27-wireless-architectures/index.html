<p>Wireless Client Authentication Methods</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Authentication<br>
original 802.11 standard offered only two choices to authenticate a client: open authentication and WEP.<br>

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)<br>
WEP same algorithm encrypts data at the sender and decrypts it at the receiver.uses the RC4 cipher algorithm to make every wireless data frame private and hidden from eavesdroppers. The The algorithm uses a string of bits as a<br>

WEP is ahead of time, so that each can derive other mutually agreeable encryption keysknown as a shared-key security method. The same key must be shared between the sender and receiver. In fact, every potential client and AP<br>
must share the same key ahead of time so that any client can associate with the AP.<br>
The WEP key use the correct WEP key, it cannot associate with an AP. The AP tests the client’s knowledge of the WEP key by can also be used as an optional authentication method as well as an encryption tool. Unless a client can<br>

Connecting a Cisco WLC<br>
Cisco wireless controllers differ a bit; ports and interfaces refer to different concepts.<br>
Controller ports are physical connections made to an external wired or switched network, whereas interfaces are logical connections made internally within the controller</p>
<p>Using WLC Ports<br>
You can connect several different types of controller ports to your network, as shown in Figure 29 - 5 and discussed in the following list:<br>
<strong>Service port:</strong> functions; always connects to a switch port in access modeUsed for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot<br>
<strong>Distribution system port:</strong> to a switch port in 802.1Q trunk modeUsed for all normal AP and management traffic; usually connects<br>
<strong>Console port:</strong> functions; asynchronous connection to a terminal emulator (9600 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop Used for out-of-band management, system recovery, and initial boot<br>
bit, by default)<br>
<strong>Redundancy port:</strong> Used to connect to a peer controller for high availability (HA) operation<br>
Controllers can have a single service port that must be connected to a switched network. Usually, the service port is assigned to a management VLAN so that you can access the controller with SSH<br>
or a web browser to perform initial configuration or for maintenance. Notice that the service port supports only a single VLAN, so the corresponding switch port must be configured for access mode<br>
only.<br>
Controllers also have multiple distribution system ports that you must connect to the network. These ports carry most of the data coming to and going from the controller. For example, the<br>
CAPWAP tunnels (control and data) that extend to each of a controller’s APs pass across the distribution system ports. Client data also passes from wireless LANs to wired VLANs over the<br>
ports. In addition, any management traffic using a web browser, SSH, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), and so on, normally reaches<br>
the controller in-band through the ports.<br>
the distribution system ports always operate in 802.1Q trunking mode.<br>
The distribution system ports can operate independently, each one transporting multiple VLANs to a unique group of internal controller interfaces. For resiliency, you can configure<br>
distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>distribution system ports in redundant pairs. One port is primarily used; if it fails, a backup port is used instead.
Controller distribution system ports can be configured as a link aggregation group (LAG) such that they are bundled together to act as one larger link
traffic can be load-balanced across the individual ports that make up the LAG
LAG offers resiliency; if one individual port fails, traffic will be redirected to the remaining working ports instead.
Cisco WLCs do not support any link aggregation negotiation protocol, like LACP or PAgP, at all.</code></pre></div>
<p>Using WLC Interfaces<br>
the controller must somehow map those wired VLANs to equivalent logical wireless networks<br>
APs.VLAN must be connected to a unique wireless LAN that exists on a controller and its associated<br>
Cisco wireless controllers provide the necessary connectivity through internal logical interfaces, which must be configured with an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and a Dynamic Host<br>
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Each interface is then assigned to a physical port and a VLAN ID. You can think of an interface as a Layer 3 termination on a VLAN.<br>
Cisco controllers support the following interface types:<br>
<strong>Management interface:</strong> authentication, WLC-to-WLC communication, webUsed for normal management traffic, such as RADIUS user -based and SSH sessions, SNMP, Network<br>
Time Protocol (NTP), syslog, and so on. The management interface is also used to terminate CAPWAP tunnels between the controller and its APs.<br>
<strong>Redundancy management</strong> a high availability pair of controllers. The active WLC uses the management interface : The management IP address of a redundant WLC that is part of<br>
address, while the standby WLC uses the redundancy management address.<br>
<strong>Virtual interface:</strong> DHCP requests, performing client web authentication, and supporting client mobility.IP address facing wireless clients when the controller is relaying client<br>
<strong>Service port interface:</strong> Bound to the service port and used for out-of-band management.<br>
<strong>Dynamic interface:</strong> Used to connect a VLAN to a WLAN.</p>
<p>The management interface faces the switched network, where management users and APs are located. Management traffic will usually consist of protocols like HTTPS, SSH, SNMP, NTP, TFTP,<br>
and so on<br>
consists of CAPWAP packets that carry control and data tunnels to and from the APs.<br>
The virtual interface is used only for certain client-facing operations.<br>
when a wireless client issues a request to obtain an IP address, the controller can relay the request on to an actual DHCP server that can provide the appropriate IP address<br>
DHCP server appears to be the controller’s virtual interface address. Clients may see the virtual interface’s address, but that address is never used when the controller<br>
communicates with other devices on the switched network.<br>
Because the virtual interface is used only for some client management functions, you should configure it with a unique, nonroutable address. For example, you might use 10.1.1.1<br>
because it is within a private address space defined in RFC 1918.<br>
The virtual interface address is also used to support client mobility.<br>
every controller that exists in the same mobility group should be configured with a virtual address that is identical to the others. By using one common virtual address, all<br>
the controllers will appear to operate as a cluster as clients roam from controller to controller.<br>
Dynamic interfaces map WLANs to VLANs,<br>
making the logical connections between wireless and wired networks. You will configure one dynamic interface for each wireless LAN that is offered by the controller’s APs and then<br>
map the interface to the WLAN.<br>
Each dynamic interface must also be configured with its own IP address and can act as a DHCP relay for wireless clients. To filter traffic passing through a dynamic interface, you can<br>
configure an optional access list.<br>
Configuring a WLAN<br>
To complete the path between the SSID and the VLAN, as illustrated in Figure 29define a WLAN on the controller. -7, you must first</p>
<p>The controller will bind the WLAN to one of its interfaces and then push the WLAN configuration out to all of its APs by default.</p>
<p>Like VLANs, you can use WLANs to segregate wireless users and their traffic into logical networks. Users associated with one WLAN cannot cross over into another one unless their<br>
traffic is bridged or routed from one VLAN to another through the wired network infrastructure.</p>
<p>Cisco controllers support a maximum of 512 WLANs, but only 16 of them can be actively configured on an AP.<br>
Advertising each WLAN to potential wireless clients uses up valuable airtime.<br>
Every AP must broadcast beacon management frames at regular intervals to advertise the existence of a BSS</p>
<p>Beacons are normally sent 10 times per second, or once every 100 ms, at the lowest mandatory data rate<br>
if you create too many WLANs, a channel can be starved of any usable airtime<br>
always limit the number of WLANs to five or fewer; a maximum of three WLANs is best<br>
Before you create a new WLAN, think about the following parameters it will need to have:<br>
SSID string<br>
Controller interface and VLAN number<br>
