    <description>26 Wireless Wednesday, September 1, 2021 12:43 PM&#xA;the operation of a BSS hinges on the AP, the BSS is bounded by usable. This is known as thebasic service area (BSA)or cell. the area where the AP’s signal is&#xA;the cell is shown as a simple shaded circular area that centers around the AP itself.&#xA;It advertises the existence of the BSS so that devices can find it and try to join. To do that, the AP&#xA;uses a unique BSS identifier (BSSID) that is based on the AP’s own radio MAC address.&#xA;Wireless devices must also have unique MAC addresses to send wireless frames at Layer 2 over&#xA;the air.&#xA;the AP advertises the wireless network with a Service Set Identifier (SSID), which is a text string containing a logical name.Think of the BSSID as a machine-readable name tag that uniquely&#xA;identifies the BSS ambassador (the AP), and the SSID as a nonunique, humanthat identifies the wireless service. -readable name tag</description>
