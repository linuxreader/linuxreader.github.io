QoS as Mentioned in This Book<br>
“Classification and Marking” is about the marking of packets and the definition of trust<br>
boundaries.<br>
“Queuing” describes the scheduling of packets to give one type of packet priority over another.<br>
“Shaping and Policing” explains these two tools together because they are often used on opposite ends of a link.<br>
“devices get too busy.Congestion Avoidance” addresses how to manage the packet loss that occurs when network</p>
<p>Classification and Marking<br>
a type of QoS tool that by changing some bits in specific header fieldsclassifies packets based on their header contents then marks the message<br>
Classification Basics<br>
QoS tools sit in the path that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch,<br>
much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like<br>
forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).<br>
classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to<br>
take some QoS action<br>
QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against.Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in<br>
this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Matching (Classification) Basics</code></pre></div><div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Cisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex matching early in the life of a packet and then

many QoS tools support the ability to simply refer to an IP ACL,with this kind of logic:<br>

QoS, so do a particular QoS action.<br>
All these fields are matchable for QoS classification.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>not every classification can be easily made by matching with an ACL. In more challenging cases, Cisco Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR)can be used. NBAR is basically in

Marking the IP Header<br>
Marking a QoS field in the IP header works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host.<br>
IPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 headerThe original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field , as shown in Figure 11-6.<br>
gave us eight separate valueswhen converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Those last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some purpose but were not used in practice to any significant extent.</code></pre></div><p>DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for64 unique values<br>
that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and<br>
using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.<br>
IPv6 has a similar field to mark as well.The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP,<br>
with the byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.<br>

<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>traffic.
A shaper’s time interval refers to its internal logic and how a shaper averages, over time, sending at a particular rate
Because the interface transmits bits at 1 Gbps, it takes just .2 seconds, or 200 ms, to send all 200 million bits. Then the shaper must wait for the rest of the
time interval, another 800 ms, before beginning the next time interval.</code></pre></div><div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>configure a short time interval so there is less wait time
Tc = 1 second (1000 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 200 ms, rest for 800 ms
Tc = .1 second (100 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 20 ms, rest for 80 ms
Tc = .01 second (10 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 2 ms, rest for 8 ms
When shaping, use a short time interval. By recommendation, use a interval to support voice and video. 10 - ms time
key features of shapers:
Key Topic.
Shapers measure the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured shaping rate.
Shapers allow for bursting after a period of inactivity.
Shapers areenabled on an interface for egress (outgoing packets).
Shapers slow down packets by queuing them and over time releasing them from the queue at the shaping rate.
Shapers use queuing tools to create and schedule the shaping queues, which is very
important for the same reasons discussed for output queuing.</code></pre></div><h4 id="congestion-avoidance">Congestion Avoidance</h4>
