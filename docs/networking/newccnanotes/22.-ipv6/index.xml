    <description>22. IPv6 Friday, August 27, 2021 2:01 PM&#xA;Endpackets if the host is in a different subnet.-user hosts need to know the IPv6 address of a default router, to which the host sends IPv6 IPv6 routers de-encapsulate and re-encapsulate each IPv6 packet when routing the packet. IPv6 routers make routing decisions by comparing the IPv6 packet’s destination address to the router’s IPv6 routing table; the matched route lists directions of where to send the IPv6 packet next. Note You could take the preceding list and replace every instance of IPv6 with IPv4, and all the statements would be true of IPv4 as well. the router must look at a protocol type field in the data-link header, which identifies the type of packet inside the dataIPv6 packet. -link frame. Today, most data-link frames carry either an IPv4 packet or an To route an IPv6 packet, a router must use its IPv6 routing table instead of the IPv4 routing table. the process works like IPv4, except that the IPv6 packet lists IPv6 addresses, and the IPv6 routing table lists routing information for IPv6 subnets (called prefixes). (The migration strategy of running both IPv4 and IPv6 is called dual stack.) All you have to do is configure the router to route IPv6 packets, in addition to the existing configuration for routing IPv4 packets. Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) were all updated to support IPv6.
