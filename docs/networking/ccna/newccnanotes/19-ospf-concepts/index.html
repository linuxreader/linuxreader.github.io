<p>Administrative Distance</p>
<p>If one company uses OSPF and the other uses EIGRP on at least one router, both OSPF and EIGRP must be used. Then thatrouter can take routes learned by OSPF and advertise them into EIGRP,<br>
and vice versa, through a process called route redistribution.<br>
When a single routing protocol learns multiple routes to the same subnet, the metric tells it which route is best. However,when two different routing protocols learn routes to the same<br>
subnet, because each routing protocol’s metric is based on different information, IOS cannot<br>
compare the metrics<br>
When IOSconcept called administrative distancemust choose between routes learned using different routing protocols, IOS uses a .Administrative distanceis a number that denotes how<br>
believable an entire routing protocol is on a single routermore believable, the routing protocol. For example, RIP has a default administrative distance of .The lower the number, the better,or<br>
120, OSPF uses a default of 110, and EIGRP defaults to 90. When using OSPF and EIGRP, the<br>
router will believe the EIGRP route instead of the OSPF route (at least by default).administrative distance values are configured on a single router and are not exchanged with The<br>

<strong>10.1.130.253 210</strong> defines the same static route with an administrative distance of 210<br>
Topology Information and LSAs<br>
Each LSA is a data structure with some specific information about the network topology; the<br>
LSDB is simply the collection of all the LSAs known to a router.<br>
before sending an LSA to yet another neighbor, routers communicate, asking “Do you already have this LSA?,” and then sending the LSA to the next neighbor only if the neighbor has not yet<br>
learned about the LSA.<br>
Routers reflood an LSA when some information changes(for example, when a link goes up or<br>
comes down). They also minutes). reflood each LSA based on each LSA’s separate aging timer(default 30</p>

OSPF neighbors are routers that both use OSPF and both sit on the same data link.can become OSPF neighbors if connected to the same VLAN, or same serial link, or same Two routers<br>

they must send OSPF messages and agree to become OSPF neighbors.To do so, therouters send<br>
OSPF Hello messages, introducing themselves to the potential neighbor. Assuming the two potential neighbors have compatible OSPF parameters, the two form an OSPF neighbor<br>
relationship, and would be displayed in the output of the <strong>show ip ospf neighbor</strong> command.<br>
allows new routers to be dynamically discovered. That means new routers can be added to a<br>
network without requiring every router to be reconfiguredHello messages from new routers and react to those messages, attempting to become neighbors. Instead, OSPF routers listen for OSPF<br>
and exchange LSDBs.<br>
Meeting Neighbors and Learning Their Router ID<br>
process starts with messages called OSPF Hello messages. The Hellos in turn list each router’s<br>
router ID (RID), which serves as each router’s unique name or identifier for OSPF. does several checks of the information in the Hello messages to ensure that the two routers Finally, OSPF<br>
should become neighbors.<br>
OSPF RIDs are 32 - bit numbers.</p>
<p>OSPF RIDs are 32 - bit numbers.<br>
By default, IOS chooses one of the router’s interface IPv4 addresses to use as its OSPF RID.However, the OSPF RID can be directly configured</p>

<p>OSPF routers listen for packets sent to IP multicast address 224.0.0.5, in part hoping to receive Hello packets and learn about new neighbors.</p>
<p>Each router keeps an OSPF state variable for how it views the neighbor.</p>
<p>Hello. This message tells R1 that R2 exists, and it allows R1 to move through the init state and<br>
quickly to a 2-way state.<br>
The 2are true:-way state is a particularly important OSPF state. At that point, the following major facts</p>
<p>(^2) it is ready to begin a 2-way means that the router is available to exchange its LSDB with the neighbor.-way exchange of the LSDB. In other words,<br>
First, they tell each other a list of LSAs in their respective databases—not all the details of the<br>
LSAs, just a list. (Think of these lists as checklists.) Then each router can check which LSAs it already has and then ask the other router for only the LSAs that are not known yet.<br>
the OSPF messages that actually send the LSAs between neighbors are called Link(LSU) packets.That is, the LSU packet holds data structures called link-state advertisements -State Update<br>
(LSA). The LSAs are not packets, but rather data structures that sit inside the LSDB and describe the topology.<br>
Maintaining Neighbors and the LSDB<br>
First, the Hello Interval and the Dead Interval. routers monitor each neighbor relationship using Hello messages and two related timers:Routers send Hellos every Hello Interval to each<br>
neighbor.so if a neighbor is silent for the length of the Each router expects to receive a Hello from each neighbor based on the Hello Interval, Dead Interval (by default, four times as long as the<br>
Hello Interval),the loss of Hellos means that the neighbor has failed.<br>

<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Next, routers must react when the topology changes as well,
Each router’s LSDB now reflects the fact that the original router’s G0/0 interface failed, so each router will then use SPF to recalculate any routes affected by the failed interface.
A third maintenance task done by neighbors is to reflood each LSA occasionally, even when the network is completely stable. By default, each router that creates an LSA also has the
responsibility to reflood the LSA every 30 minutes (the default), even if no changes occurthateach LSA has a separate timer, based on when the LSA was created, so there is no single big. (Note

These five OSPF routers elect one router to act as the DR and one router to be a backup DR

The database exchange process on an Ethernet link does not happen between every pair of
routers on the same VLAN/subnet. Instead, it happens between the DR and each of the other routers,with the DR making sure that all the other routers get a copy of each LSA.
The BDR watches the status of the DR and takes over for the DR if it fails. (When the DR fails, the
BDR takes over, and then a new BDR is elected.)

<p>How Areas Reduce SPF Calculation Time<br>
Routers requirefewer CPU cycles to process the smaller per-area LSDB with the SPF algorithm,<br>
reducing CPU overhead and improving convergence time.<br>
The smaller per-area LSDB requires less memory.<br>
Changes in the network (for example, links failing and recovering) require SPF calculations only<br>
on routers in the area where the link changed state, reducing the number of routers that must rerun SPF.<br>
Less information must be advertised between areas, reducing the bandwidth required to send LSAs.</p>
