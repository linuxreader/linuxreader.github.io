<p>Configuring the OSPF Router ID<br>
most enterprise networks that use OSPF choose to configure each router’s OSPF router ID<br>
If therouter-id rid OSPF subcommand is configured, this value is used as the RID.<br>
If any loopback interfaces have an IP address configured, status of up, the router picks the highest numeric IP address among these loopback interfaces.and the interface has an interface<br>
The router picks the code (first status code) is up. (In other words, an interface in up/down state will be included by highest numeric IP address from all other interfaces whose interface status<br>

change the RID immediately. Instead, IOS waits until the next time the OSPF process is restarted.<br>
OSPF Interface Configuration Example<br>
Step 1. Use the <strong>no network network-id area area-id</strong> subcommands in OSPF configuration mode<br>
to remove the network commands.<br>
Step 2. Add one <strong>ip ospf process-id area area-id</strong> command in interface configuration mode under<br>
each interface on which OSPF should operate,correct OSPF area number. with the correct OSPF process (process-id) and the</p>

<p>Verifying OSPF Interface Configuration</p>
<p>Additional OSPFv2 Features<br>
Passive interfaces<br>
Default routes<br>
Metrics<br>
Load balancing<br>
OSPF Passive Interfaces<br>
When no routers exist on a link<br>
OSPF continues to advertise about the subnet that is connected to the interface.<br>
OSPF no longer sends OSPF Hellos on the interface.<br>
OSPF no longer processes any received Hellos on the interface.<br>
OSPF still advertises about the connected subnet, but OSPF also does not form neighbor<br>
relationships over the interface.<br>
First, configuration mode:you can add the following command to the configuration of the OSPF process, in router<br>
<strong>passive-interface</strong> <em>type number</em><br>
Alternately, the configuration can change the default setting so that all interfaces are passive by default and then add a <strong>no passive-interface</strong> command for all interfaces that need to not be<br>
passive:<br>
<strong>passive-interface default<br>
no passive-interface</strong> <em>type number</em></p>
<p>The passive interfaces. <strong>show ip ospf interface brief</strong> command lists all interfaces on which OSPF is enabled, including<br>
The <strong>show ip ospf interface</strong> command lists a single line that mentions that the interface is passive.<br>
OSPF Default Routes<br>
All routers learn specific (nondefault) routes for subnets inside the company; a default route is not needed when forwarding packets to these destinations.<br>
One router connects to the Internet, and it has a default route that points toward the Internet.<br>
All routers should dynamically learn a default route,that all packets destined to locations in the Internet go to the one router connected to the used for all traffic going to the Internet, so<br>
Internet.<br>
<strong>default</strong> using OSPF to the remote routers (B1 and B2). <strong>- information originate</strong> command (Step 2) makes the router advertise a default route</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>The default-information originate always router subcommand tells the router to always
advertise the default route, no matter whether the router’s default route is working or not.</code></pre></div>
<p>OSPF Metrics (Cost)<br>
Cisco routers allow three different ways to change the OSPF interface cost:<br>
Directly, using the interface subcommand <strong>ip ospf cost x</strong>.<br>
Using the default calculation per interface, and changing the interface bandwidth setting, which changes the calculated value.<br>
Using the default calculation per interface, and changing the OSPF reference bandwidth setting, which changes the calculated value.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>The output also shows a cost value of 1 for the other Gigabit interfaces, which is the default OSPF
cost for any interface faster than 100 Mbps.</code></pre></div>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>interface bandwidth setting does not influence the actual transmission speed.Instead, the
interface bandwidth acts as a configurable setting to represent the speed of the interface, with the option to configure the bandwidth to match the actual transmission speed...or not
configuration of the interface bandwidth using bandwidth speed interfacesubcommand.
Reference_bandwidth / Interface_bandwidth
you should cost. avoid changing the interface bandwidth as a means to influence the default OSPF
any interface with an interface bandwidth of 100 Mbps or faster ties with a calculated OSPF cost of 1 when using the default reference bandwidth. So, when relying on the default OSPF cost
calculation, it helps to configure the reference bandwidth to another value.</code></pre></div>
<p>Setting the Cost Based on Interface and Reference Bandwidth</p>
<p>You can still use OSPF’s default cost calculation (and many do) just by changing the reference<br>
bandwidth with the <strong>auto-cost reference-bandwidth speed</strong> OSPF mode subcommand<br>
For instance, routers to use autoin an enterprise whose fastest links are 10 Gbps (10,000 Mbps), you could set all -cost reference-bandwidth 10000, meaning 10,000 Mbps or 10 Gbps. In that<br>
case, by default, a 10cost of 10, and a 100&ndash;MBps link a cost of 100Gbps link would have an OSPF cost of 1, while a 1. -Gbps link would have a<br>
Set the cost explicitly, using the 65,535, inclusive. ip ospf cost x interface subcommand, to a value between 1 and<br>
Although it should be avoided, change the interface bandwidth with the <strong>bandwidth speed</strong><br>
command,with speed being a number in kilobits per second (Kbps).<br>
Change the reference bandwidth, using router OSPF subcommandauto-cost reference-<br>
bandwidth ref-bw, with a unit of megabits per second (Mbps).<br>
OSPF Load Balancing<br>
when the metrics tie for multiple routes to the same subnet, the router can put multiple equalcost routes in the routing table (the default is four different routes) based on the setting of the -<br>
maximum-paths number router subcommand<br>
the default (and better) method, the load balancing could be on a per-destination IP address<br>
basis.</p>
