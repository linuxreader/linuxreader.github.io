<p>Configuration Drift</p>
<p>The on-device manual configuration process does not track change history: which lines changed, what changed on each line, what old configuration was removed, who changed the configuration, when each change was made.
External systems used by good systems management processes, like trouble ticketing and change management software, may record details. However, those sit outside the configuration and
require analysis to figure out what changed. They also rely on humans to follow the operational processes consistently and correctly; otherwise, an engineer cannot find the entire history of
changes to a configuration.
Referring to historical data in change management systems works poorly if a device has gone through multiple configuration changes over a period of time.
Centralized Configuration Files and Version Control</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code></code></pre></div>

the change occurred, and so on.

The automated configuration management software asks for a copy of the device’s runningconfig file, as shown in steps 1 and 2. At step 3, the config management software compares the -
ideal config file with the just-arrived running-config file to check whether they have any
differences (configuration drift). Per the configuration of the tool, it either fixes the configuration or notifies the staff about the configuration drift.</p>

Configuration Templates and Variables</code></pre></div>
<p>Configuration management tools can separate the components of a configuration into the parts
in common to all devices in that role (the variables) (the template)versus the parts unique to any one device</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code></code></pre></div>
<p>Ansible using the Jinja2 language for templates</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>To supply the values for a device,Ansible calls for defining variable files using YAML

using templates has some big advantages.  
Templates helping to avoid snowflakes (uniquely configured devices).increase the focus on having a standard configuration for each device role,  
New devices with an existing role can be deployed easily by simply copying an existing per-  
device variable file and changing the values.  
Templatesallow for easier troubleshooting because troubleshooting issues with one  
standard template should find and fix issues with all devices that use the same template.  
Tracking the file versions for the template versus the variables files allows for easier troubleshooting as well. Issues with a device can be investigated to find changes in the  
device’s settings separately from the standard configuration template.  
Files That Control Configuration Automation  
Configuration management tools provide methods that tell the tool what changes to make, to  
which devices, and when  
the files you could see in any of the configuration management tools.

Ansible, Puppet, and Chef Basics  
some of the tools do not run in a Windows OS</code></pre></div>
<p>you need to install Ansible on some computer: Mac, Linux, or a Linux VM
free open-source version or use the paid Ansible Tower serverversion
Once it is installed, you create several text files, such as the following:</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code></code></pre></div>
<p>Ansible</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code></code></pre></div>
<p>Playbooks:These files provide actions and logic about what Ansible should do.
Inventory:These files provide device hostnames along with information about each
device, like device roles, so Ansible can perform functions for subsets of the inventory
Templates: Using Jinja2 language, the templates represent a device’s configuration
but with variables(see Example 19-2).
Variablestemplates: Using YAML, a file can list variables that Ansible will substitute into (see Example 19-3).
uses an agentlessarchitecture
Ansible does not rely on any code (agent) running on the network device
Ansiblemake changes and extract information.relies on features typical in network devices, namely SSH and/or NETCONF, to
using apush model(per Figure 19-8) rather than a pull model (like Puppet and Chef)</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Ansible can do both configuration provisioning (configuring devices after changes are made in the files) and configuration monitoring (checking to find out whether the device config  
matches the ideal configuration on the control node).  
To do configuration monitoring, Ansible uses logic modules that detect and list configuration differences, after which the playbook defines what action to take (reconfigure  
or notify).  
Puppet  
installing Puppet on aLinuxhost  
install it on aLinux server called a Puppet master  
free open-source version with paid versions available  
Puppet also uses several important text files with different components</code></pre></div>
<p>Manifest: This is a human-readable text file on the Puppet master, using a language
defined by Puppet, used to define the desired configuration state of a device.
Resource, Class, Modulelargest component (module) being composed of smaller classes, which are in turn : These terms refer to components of the manifest, with the
composed of resources.
Templates: Using a Puppet domain-specific language, these files allow Puppet to
generate manifests (and modules, classes, and resources) by substituting variables into the template.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Ansible’s playbooks use an imperative language, whereas Puppet uses a declarative language

with Ansible, the playbook will list tasks and choices based on those results, like  
“Configure all branch routers in these locations, and if errors occur for any device, do these extra tasks for that device.” Puppet manifests instead declare the end state that  
a device should have: “This branch router should have the configuration in this file by the end of the process.” The manifest, built by the engineer, defines the end state,  
and Puppet has the job to cause the device to have that configuration, without being  
told the specific set of steps to take.  
uses an agent-based architecture for network device support.  
Some network devices enable Puppet support via an on-device agent  
not every Cisco OS supports Puppet agents, so Puppet solves that problem usinga proxy  
agent running on some external hostuses SSH to communicate with the network device(calledagentless operation). The external agent then

Chef requires onclient, so you will likely see more use of Ansible and Puppet for Cisco device configuration -device Chef client code, and many Cisco devices do not support a Chef

Summary of Configuration Management Tools  
Ansible appears to have the most interest, then Puppet, and then Chef. Ansible’s agentless  
architecture and the use of SSH provides support for a wide range of Cisco devices. Puppet’s agentless model also creates wide support for Cisco devices.  
the column for Puppet assumes an on-device agent.

- Voice traffic is vulnerable to degradation and deterioration if traffic is sent unevenly

- - Voice traffic is vulnerable to degradation and deterioration if traffic is sent unevenly802.1p
- - Ip Phones support QoSQos uses the CoS value to prioritize the forwarding of voice and data packets
- if the data packets from the node connected to the phone have a higher priority than voice traffic on the phone, data packets could take precedence
- - Voice data traffic on phones is 5 by defaultVoice signaling traffic is 3 by default
- Can configure the phone so that it does not override CoS values coming from the host for mission critical data
    - any VTP advertisements received by transparentregardless of domain name configuration -mode switches will be forwarded on all trunk ports
