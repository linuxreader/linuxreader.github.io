<p>By sending data through the AP first, the BSS remains stable and under control.<br>
Distribution System<br>
The 802.11 standard refers to the upstream wired Ethernet as the distribution system (DS) for the wireless BSS,<br>
the AP is in charge of mapping a virtual local-area network (VLAN) to an SSID.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>The AP must be connected to the switch by a trunk link that carries the VLANs.

<p>Extended Service Set<br>
When APs are placed at different geographic locations, they can all be interconnected by a switched infrastructure. The 802.11 standard calls this an extended service set (ESS),<br>
Ideally,any SSIDs that are defined on one AP should be defined on all the APs in an ESS<br>

<p>Mesh Network<br>
In a mesh topology, wireless traffic is bridged from AP to AP, in a daisy-chain fashion, using<br>
another wireless channel.<br>
Mesh APs can leverage dual radiosone a different range. Each mesh AP usually maintains a BSS on one channel, with which —one using a channel in one range of frequencies and<br>
wireless clients can associate. Client traffic is then usually bridged from AP to AP over other channels as a backhaul network.<br>
The mesh network runs its own dynamic routing protocol to work out the best path for backhaul traffic to take across the mesh APs.</p>

Electromagnetic waves do not travel in a straight line. Instead, they travel by expanding in all directions away from the antenna.<br>

<p>3 kHz to 300 GHz is commonly called radio frequency (RF).<br>
Wireless Bands and Channels</p>
<p>Wireless Bands and Channels<br>
Because a range of frequencies might be used for the same purpose, it is customary to refer to the range as a band of frequencies.<br>
the range from 530 kHz to around 1710 kHz is used by AM radio stations; therefore, it is commonly called the AM band or the AM broadcast band.<br>
One of the two main frequency ranges used for wireless LAN communication lies between 2.400<br>
and 2.4835 GHz. This is usually called the 2.4entire range between 2.4 and 2.5 GHz -GHz band, even though it does not encompass the<br>
The other wireless LAN range is usually called the 55.825 GHz. The 5-GHz band actually contains the following four separate and distinct bands:-GHz band because it lies between 5.150 and<br>
5.150 to 5.250 GHz<br>
5.250 to 5.350 GHz<br>
5.470 to 5.725 GHz<br>
5.725 to 5.825 GHz<br>
Gap between 5.350 and 5.470 this gap exists and cannot be used for wireless LANs.<br>
Do not worry about memorizing the band names or exact frequency ranges; just be aware of the two main bands at 2.4 and 5 GHz.<br>
A frequency band contains a continuous range of frequencies.<br>
bands are usually divided into a number of distinct channels. Each channel is known by a channel<br>
number and is assigned to a specific frequency.</p>
<p>In the 5not encroach on or overlap the frequencies allocated for any other channel. In other words, the 5-GHz band, this is the case because each channel is allocated a frequency range that does -<br>
GHz band consists of nonoverlapping channels.<br>
APs and Wireless Standards</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Wireless client devices and APs can be compatible with one or more amendments;

<p>wireless clients typically associate with an AP on one band at a time, while scanning for potential APs on both bands. The band used to connect to an AP is chosen according to the operating<br>
system, wireless adapter driver, and other internal configuration.<br>
Cisco APs have dual radios (sets of transmitters and receivers) to support BSSs on one 2.4channel and other BSSs on one 5-GHz channel simultaneously. Some models also have two 5-GHz -GHz<br>
radios that can be configured to operate BSSs on two different channels at the same time,<br>
providing wireless coverage to higher densities of users that are located in the same vicinity.<br>
RF signals propagate or reach further on the 2.4to penetrate indoor walls and objects easier at 2.4 GHz than 5 GHz. However, the 2.4-GHz band than on the 5-GHz band. They also tend -GHz band is<br>
commonly more crowded with wireless devices. Remember that only three nonoverlapping channels are available, so the chances of other neighboring APs using the same channels is<br>
greater. In contrast, the 5-GHz band has many more channels available to use, making channels<br>
less crowded and experiencing less interference.</p>
<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:<br>
2.0 Network Access<br>
2.6 Compare Cisco Wireless Architectures and AP modes</p>
<p>Autonomous AP Architecture<br>
VLANs must be trunked from the distribution layer switch (where routing commonly takes place) to the access layer, where they are extended further over a trunk link to the AP.<br>
Two wireless users that are associated to the same autonomous AP can reach each other through the AP without having to pass up into the wired network</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>configure SSIDs, VLANs, and many RF parameters like the channel and transmit power to be used.</code></pre></div>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>An autonomous AP must also be configured with a management IP address so that you can remotely manage it.</code></pre></div>
<p>management address is not normally part of any of the data VLANs, so a dedicated management<br>
VLAN (i.e., VLAN 10) must be added to the trunk links to reach the AP.<br>
Each AP must be configured and maintained individually unless you leverage a management platform such as Cisco Prime Infrastructure or Cisco DNA Center.<br>
That might sound straightforward until you have to add a new VLAN and configure every switch<br>
and AP in your network to carry and support it.<br>
Cloud-based AP Architecture<br>
Cisco Meraki is cloudnetworks built from Meraki products. For example, through the cloud networking service, you can -based and offers centralized management of wireless, switched, and security<br>
configure and manage APs, monitor wireless performance and activity, generate reports, and so<br>
on.<br>
Cisco Meraki APs can be deployed automatically, once you register with the Meraki cloud. Each AP will contact the cloud when it powers up and will self-configure. From that point on, you can<br>
manage the AP through the Meraki cloud dashboard.<br>
From the cloud, you can push out code upgrades and configuration changes to the APs in the<br>
enterprise<br>
adds the intelligence needed to automatically instruct each AP on which channel and transmit power level to use.<br>
Can also collect information from all of the APs about things such as RF interference, rogue or<br>
unexpected wireless devices that were overheard, and wireless usage statistics.</p>
