Overview of Switching Logic
-Forward or filter frame based on destination MAC AddressExamine source MAC address of each frame received
Learning MAC Addresses If a frame enters the switch and the source MAC address is not in the MAC address table, the switch creates an entry in the table when there is no matching entry in the table, switches forward the frame out all interfaces (except the incoming interface) (Flooding)
STP either a blocking state or a forwarding state. Blocking 餃글nterface cannot forward or receive data frames forwarding餃글nterface can send and receive data frames.
LAN Switching Summary
Forward Frames based on destination MAC address If the destination MAC address is a broadcast, multicast, or unknown destination unicast (a unicast not listed in the MAC table), the switch floods the frame. If the destination MAC address is a known unicast address (a unicast address found in the MAC table): the switch forwards the frame out the outgoing interface.If the outgoing interface is the same as the interface in which the frame was received, the switch filters the frame
learning MAC address table entries: examine the source MAC address on each frame received and note the interface from which the frame was received. If it is not already in the table, add the MAC address and interface it was learned on.
Verifying and Analyzing Ethernet Switching -interfaces are enabled by default10/100 and 10/100/1000 interfaces use autonegotiation by default.
