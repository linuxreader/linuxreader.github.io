Blocking ○interface cannot forward or receive data frames forwarding○interface can send and receive data frames.&#xA;LAN Switching Summary&#xA;Forward Frames based on destination MAC address If the destination MAC address is a broadcast, multicast, or unknown destination unicast (a unicast not listed in the MAC table), the switch floods the frame. If the destination MAC address is a known unicast address (a unicast address found in the MAC table): the switch forwards the frame out the outgoing interface.If the outgoing interface is the same as the interface in which the frame was received, the switch filters the frame&#xA;learning MAC address table entries: examine the source MAC address on each frame received and note the interface from which the frame was received. If it is not already in the table, add the MAC address and interface it was learned on.&#xA;Verifying and Analyzing Ethernet Switching -interfaces are enabled by default10/100 and 10/100/1000 interfaces use autonegotiation by default.&#xA;Demonstrating MAC Learning&#xA;#show mac address - View mac address table - table&#xA;#show mac address - Show only dynamically learned MAC addresses - table dynamic&#xA;#show interfaces status - status of all interfaces (connected or disconnected)&#xA;#show interfaces f0/1 status - interface status of f0/&#xA;#show interfaces f0/1 - Displays detailed set of messages about the interface&#xA;#show interfaces f0/1 counters - Lists the number of unicast, multicast, and broadcast frames (inbound and outbound), and total byte count for those frames&#xA;#show mac address - Shows MAC entry for a single MAC address - table dynamic address 0200.1111.&#xA;#show mac address - Shows MAC entries for a single interface - table dynamic interface fastEthernet 0/ Quick Commands MAC Addresses #show mac address#show mac address--tabletable dynamic #show interfaces status#show interfaces f0/1 status #show interfaces f0/1show interfaces f0/1 counters #show mac address#show mac address--table dynamic address 0200.1111.1111table dynamic interface fastEthernet 0/ #show mac address-table dynamic vlan 1 Managing MAC tables #show mac address#show mac address--table agingtable count-time #(en)clear mac address#(en)clear mac address--table dynamictable dynamic vlan 1 #(en)clear mac address#(en)clear mac address--table dynamic interface fa0/1table dynamic address 3d44.2aab.12c 5.
