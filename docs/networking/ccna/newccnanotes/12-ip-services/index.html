manager<br>
a network management application running on a PC or server<br>
typically being called a Network Management Station (NMS)<br>
uses SNMP protocols to communicate with each SNMP agent.<br>
Cisco Primeseries of management products (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/go/prime" rel="external" target="_blank">www.cisco.com/go/prime</a>) use SNMP (and<br>
other protocols) to manage networks.<br>

<p>SNMP Variable Reading and Writing: SNMP Get and Set<br>
NMS typically polls the SNMP agent on each device<br>
NMS can notify the human user in front of the PC or send emails, texts, and so on to notify<br>
the network operations staff of any issues identified by the data found by polling the devices. You can even reconfigure the device through these SNMP variables in the MIB if<br>
you permit this level of control.<br>
NMS uses the SNMPGet messages)to ask for information from an agent.Get, GetNext, and GetBulk messages(together referenced simply as<br>
NMS sends an SNMP Set message to write variables on the SNMP agent as a means to change the configuration of the device.</p>

organizes all the variables into a hierarchy of OIDs, usually shown as a tree<br>
Each node in the tree can be described based on the tree structure sequence, either by name or by number.</p>
<p>you could use an SNMP manager and type MIB variable 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.58.0 and click a<br>

Securing SNMP</p>
<p>Securing SNMP<br>
use ACLs to limit SNMP messages to those from known servers only.<br>
can configure an IPv4 ACL to filter incoming SNMP messages that arrive in IPv4 packets and an IPv6 ACL to filter SNMP messages that arrive in IPv6 packets.<br>
all versions of SNMP support a basic clear-text password mechanism,<br>
SNMPv1 defined clear-text passwords called SNMP communities.<br>
SNMP agent and the SNMP manager need prior knowledge of the same SNMP community value (called a community string)<br>
Get messages and the Set message include the appropriate community string value, in clear text.<br>
NMS sends a Get or Set with the correct community string, as configured on the<br>
SNMP agent, the agent processes the message.<br>
SNMPv1 defines both a read-only community and a read-write community.<br>
read-only (RO) community allows Get messages, and the read-write (RW)<br>
community allows both reads and writes (Gets and Sets).</p>

Navigate directories : List the current directory, change the current directory to
a new directory, go back to the home directory, all on both the server and client side of the connection.
Add/remove directories: Create new directories and remove existing
directories on both the client and server.
List files : List files on both the client and server.
File transfer: Get (client gets a copy of the file from the server), Put (client takes
a file that exists on the client and puts a copy of the FTP server).
FTP Active and Passive Modes
may impact whether the TCP client can or cannot connect to the server and
perform normal functions
user at the FTP client can choose which mode to use
FTP passive mode may be the more likely option to work.
FTP uses two types of TCP connections:</code></pre></div>
<p>FTP uses two types of TCP connections:<br>
Control Connection: Used to exchange FTP commands<br>
Data Connection: Used for sending and receiving data, both for file transfers and for output to display to a user</p>
<p>when a client connects to an FTP server, the client first creates the FTP control connection</p>
<p>server listens for new control connections on its well-known port 21<br>
client allocates any new dynamic port (49222 in this case) and creates a TCP connection to the server</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>The FTP client allocates a currently unused dynamic port and starts
listening on that port.
The client identifies that port (and its IP address) to the FTP server by
sending an FTP PORT command to the server.
The server, because it also operates in active mode, expects the PORT command; the server reacts and initiates the FTP data connection to the
client’s address (192.168.1.102) and port (49333).</code></pre></div>
<p>Passive mode helps solve the firewall restrictions by having the FTP client<br>
initiate the FTP data connection to the server.<br>
passive mode does not simply cause the FTP client to connect to a well-known<br>
port on the server;<br>
The FTP client changes to use FTP passive mode, notifying the server using the FTP PASV command.<br>
The server chooses a port to listen on for the upcoming new TCP</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>The server chooses a port to listen on for the upcoming new TCP connection, in this case TCP port 49444.
The FTP notifies the FTP client of its IP address and chosen port with the
FTP PORT command.
The FTP client opens the TCP data connection to the IP address and port
learned at the previous step.</code></pre></div>
<p>FTP over TLS (FTP Secure)<br>
FTPS encrypts both the control and data connections with TLS, including the exchange of the usernames and passwords<br>
<strong>FTPS explicit mode process:</strong><br>
The client creates the FTP control TCP connection to server well-known port 21.<br>
The client initiates the use of TLS in the control connection with the FTP AUTH command.<br>
When the user takes an action that requires an FTP data connection, the client<br>
creates an FTP data TCP connection to server well-known port 21.<br>
The client initiates the use of TLS in the data connection with the FTP AUTH<br>
command.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>implicit mode process

<p><strong>TFTP Protocol Basics</strong><br>
Trivial File Transfer Protocol uses UDP well-known port 69. Because it uses UDP, TFTP adds a<br>
feature to check each file for transmission errors by using a checksum process on each file after the transfer completes.<br>
the code requires less space to install, which can be useful for devices with limited memory.<br>
