provides a message format for communication between what are termed managers and agents<br>
manager<br>
a network management application running on a PC or server<br>
typically being called a Network Management Station (NMS)<br>
uses SNMP protocols to communicate with each SNMP agent.<br>
Cisco Primeseries of management products (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/go/prime" rel="external" target="_blank">www.cisco.com/go/prime</a>) use SNMP (and<br>
other protocols) to manage networks.<br>
agents<br>

variables on that device that describe the device’s configuration, status, and counters.<br>

IOS on routers and switches include an SNMP agent, with builtwith the configuration shown later -in MIB, that can be enabled</p>
<p>SNMP Variable Reading and Writing: SNMP Get and Set<br>
NMS typically polls the SNMP agent on each device<br>
NMS can notify the human user in front of the PC or send emails, texts, and so on to notify<br>
the network operations staff of any issues identified by the data found by polling the devices. You can even reconfigure the device through these SNMP variables in the MIB if<br>
you permit this level of control.<br>
NMS uses the SNMPGet messages)to ask for information from an agent.Get, GetNext, and GetBulk messages(together referenced simply as<br>
NMS sends an SNMP Set message to write variables on the SNMP agent as a means to change the configuration of the device.</p>

Each node in the tree can be described based on the tree structure sequence, either by name or by number.</p>

Securing SNMP</p>

use ACLs to limit SNMP messages to those from known servers only.<br>
can configure an IPv4 ACL to filter incoming SNMP messages that arrive in IPv4 packets and an IPv6 ACL to filter SNMP messages that arrive in IPv6 packets.<br>
all versions of SNMP support a basic clear-text password mechanism,<br>
SNMPv1 defined clear-text passwords called SNMP communities.<br>
SNMP agent and the SNMP manager need prior knowledge of the same SNMP community value (called a community string)<br>
Get messages and the Set message include the appropriate community string value, in clear text.<br>
NMS sends a Get or Set with the correct community string, as configured on the<br>
SNMP agent, the agent processes the message.<br>
SNMPv1 defines both a read-only community and a read-write community.<br>
read-only (RO) community allows Get messages, and the read-write (RW)<br>
community allows both reads and writes (Gets and Sets).</p>

passive mode does not simply cause the FTP client to connect to a well-known<br>
