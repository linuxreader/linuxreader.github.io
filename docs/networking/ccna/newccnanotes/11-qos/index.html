For example, if you open a website and connect to a web server, the web page content that moves from the server to the client is one flow.
From a voice perspective, a phone call between two IP phones would create a flow for each direction
Step 1. The phone user makes a phone call and begins speaking.
Step 2. A chip called a codec processes (digitizes) the sound to create a binary code (160

QoS as Mentioned in This Book<br>
“Classification and Marking” is about the marking of packets and the definition of trust<br>
boundaries.<br>
“Queuing” describes the scheduling of packets to give one type of packet priority over another.<br>
“Shaping and Policing” explains these two tools together because they are often used on opposite ends of a link.<br>
“devices get too busy.Congestion Avoidance” addresses how to manage the packet loss that occurs when network</p>
<p>Classification and Marking<br>
a type of QoS tool that by changing some bits in specific header fieldsclassifies packets based on their header contents then marks the message<br>
Classification Basics<br>
QoS tools sit in the path that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch,<br>
much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like<br>
forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).<br>
classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to<br>
take some QoS action<br>
QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against.Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in<br>
this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Matching (Classification) Basics</code></pre></div>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Cisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex matching early in the life of a packet and then
marking the packet. Marking means that the QoS tool changes one or more header fields, setting a value in the header.

<p>Classification on Routers with ACLs and NBAR<br>
many QoS tools support the ability to simply refer to an IP ACL,with this kind of logic:<br>
For any packet matched by the ACL with a permit action, consider that packet a match for<br>
QoS, so do a particular QoS action.<br>
All these fields are matchable for QoS classification.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>not every classification can be easily made by matching with an ACL. In more challenging cases, Cisco Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR)can be used. NBAR is basically in

Classify all voice payload traffic that is used for business purposes as IP DSCP EF and<br>
CoS 5.<br>
Classify all video conferencing and other interactive video for business purposes as IP DSCP AF41 and CoS 4.<br>
Classify all business-critical data application traffic as IP DSCP AF21 and CoS 2<br>
Marking the IP Header<br>
Marking a QoS field in the IP header works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host.<br>
IPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 headerThe original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field , as shown in Figure 11-6.<br>
gave us eight separate valueswhen converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Those last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some purpose but were not used in practice to any significant extent.</code></pre></div>
<p>DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for64 unique values<br>
that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and<br>
using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.<br>
IPv6 has a similar field to mark as well.The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP,<br>
with the byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.<br>
Marking the Ethernet 802.1Q Header<br>
marking field exists in the 802.1Q header<br>
It goes bytwo different names:Class of Service, orCoS, and Priority Code Point, or<br>
PCP.<br>

<p>Other Marking Fields</p>
<p>Defining Trust Boundaries<br>
most voice traffic is marked with a DSCP called Expediteddecimal value of 46 Forwarding (EF), which has a<br>
trust boundary<br>
the point in the path of a packet flowing through the network at which the networking devices can trust the current QoS markings</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>when the access layer includes an IP Phone, the phone is typically the trust boundary

<p>DiffServ Suggested Marking Values<br>

packets carry voice payload, and other packets carry call signaling messages.signaling messages set up (create) the voice call between two devices, and they do not Call<br>

By default, Cisco IP Phones mark voice pay-load with EF,and mark voice signaling<br>
packets sent by the phone with another value called CS3.<br>

QoS as Mentioned in This Book<br>
“Classification and Marking” is about the marking of packets and the definition of trust<br>
boundaries.<br>
“Queuing” describes the scheduling of packets to give one type of packet priority over another.<br>

<p>Classification and Marking<br>
a type of QoS tool that by changing some bits in specific header fieldsclassifies packets based on their header contents then marks the message<br>
Classification Basics<br>
QoS tools sit in the path that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch,<br>
much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like<br>
forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).<br>
classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to<br>
take some QoS action<br>
QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against.Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in<br>
this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Matching (Classification) Basics</code></pre></div>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Cisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex matching early in the life of a packet and then
marking the packet. Marking means that the QoS tool changes one or more header fields, setting a value in the header.

<p>Classification on Routers with ACLs and NBAR<br>
many QoS tools support the ability to simply refer to an IP ACL,with this kind of logic:<br>
For any packet matched by the ACL with a permit action, consider that packet a match for<br>
QoS, so do a particular QoS action.<br>
All these fields are matchable for QoS classification.</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>not every classification can be easily made by matching with an ACL. In more challenging cases, Cisco Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR)can be used. NBAR is basically in
its second major version, called NBAR2, or nextpackets for classification in a large variety of ways that are very useful for QoS.-generation NBAR. In short,NBAR2 matches

Classify all business-critical data application traffic as IP DSCP AF21 and CoS 2<br>
Marking the IP Header<br>
Marking a QoS field in the IP header works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host.<br>
IPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 headerThe original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field , as shown in Figure 11-6.<br>
gave us eight separate valueswhen converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code" dir="auto"><pre tabindex="0"><code>Those last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some purpose but were not used in practice to any significant extent.</code></pre></div>
<p>DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for64 unique values<br>
that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and<br>
using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.<br>
IPv6 has a similar field to mark as well.The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP,<br>
with the byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.<br>
Marking the Ethernet 802.1Q Header<br>

It goes bytwo different names:Class of Service, orCoS, and Priority Code Point, or<br>

most voice traffic is marked with a DSCP called Expediteddecimal value of 46 Forwarding (EF), which has a<br>
