Partial mesh: For any set of network nodes, a design that connects a link between some pairs of nodes, but not all. In other words, a mesh that is not a full mesh. Hybrid: A design that combines topology design concepts into a larger (typically more complex) design. twoand a partial mesh at the distribution layer.-tier design is indeed a hybrid design that uses both a star topology at the access layer The distribution layer creates a partial mesh. none of the access layer switches connect to each other.
