Step 2. If using a next-hop IPv6 address that is a link-local address:<br>
A. Is the link-local address an address on the correct neighboring router? (It should be<br>
an address on another router on a shared link.)<br>

<p>The Neighbor Discovery Protocol<br>
with 1pv4 ARP works as a separate protocol; with IPv6, thepart of ICMPv6,performs the same functions. Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP), a<br>
few of the functions of the NDP protocol (RFC 4861). Some of those NDP functions are<br>
Neighbor MAC Discovery:of other hosts in the same subnet. NDP replaces IPv4’s ARP, providing messages that An IPv6 LAN-based host will need to learn the MAC address<br>
replace the ARP Request and Reply messages.<br>
Router Discoverysame subnet. : Hosts learn the IPv6 addresses of the available IPv6 routers in the<br>
SLAACmessages to learn the subnet (prefix) used on the link plus the prefix length.: When using Stateless Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC), the host uses NDP<br>
DAD: Before using an IPv6 address, hosts use NDP to perform a Duplicate Address<br>
Detection (DAD) process, to ensure no other host uses the same IPv6 address before attempting to use it.<br>
Discovering Neighbor Link Addresses with NDP NS and NA<br>
using a pair of matched solicitation and advertisement messages:(NS)and Neighbor Advertisement (NA)messages. the Neighbor Solicitation<br>
the send back a replyNS acts like an IPv4 ARP request. The NA message acts like an IPv4 ARP Reply, listing that host’s MAC , asking the host with a particular unicast IPv6 address to<br>
address.<br>
Neighbor Solicitation (NS)(the target address) to reply with an NA message that lists its MAC address. : This message asks the host with a particular IPv6 address The NS<br>
message is sent to the solicitedaddress, so the message is processed only by hosts whose last six hex digits match the -node multicast address associated with the target<br>
address that is being queried.<br>
Neighbor Advertisement (NA): This message lists the sender’s IPv6 and MAC<br>
addresses. IPv6 unicast address of the host that sent the original NS messageIt can be sent in reply to an NS message, and if so, the packet is sent to the .A host can also<br>
send an unsolicited NA, announcing its IPv6 and MAC addresses, in which case the message is sent to the all-IPv6-hosts local-scope multicast address FF02::1.</p>
<p>To view a host’s NDP neighbor table, use these commands: (Windows) netsh interface ipv6<br>
show neighbors; (Linux) ip -6 neighbor show; (Mac OS) ndp -an.<br>
Discovering Routers with NDP RS and RA<br>
NDP defines two messages that allow any host to discover all routers in the subnet:<br>
Router Solicitation (RS):This message is sent to the “all-IPv6-routers” local-scope multicast<br>
address of FF02::2 so that the message asks all routers, on the local link only, to identify themselves.<br>
Router Advertisement (RA): link-local IPv6 address of the router. When sent in response to an RS message, it flows back This message, sent by the router, lists many facts, including the<br>
to either the unicast address of the host that sent the RS or to the allFF02::1. Routers also send RA messages without being asked, sent to the all-IPv6-hosts address -IPv6-hosts local-<br>
scope multicast address of FF02::1.</p>
<p>IPv6 allows multiple prefixes and multiple default routers to be listed in the RA message; Figure 25-9 just shows one of each for simplicity’s sake.<br>
also periodically send unsolicited RA messages<br>
the RA messages flow to the FF02::1 all-nodes IPv6 multicast address.<br>
Using SLAAC with NDP RS and RA</p>
<div class="highlight wrap-code"><pre tabindex="0"><code>IPv6 supports an alternative method for IPv6 hosts to dynamically choose an unused IPv6 address
to use
The process goes by the nameStateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).
Learn the IPv6 prefix used on the link, from any router, using NDP RS/RA messages.
Build an address from the prefix plus an interface ID, chosen either by using EUI-64 rules or
as a random value.
Before using the address, first use DAD to make sure that no other host is already using the same address.</code></pre></div>
<p>Discovering Duplicate Addresses Using NDP NS and NA<br>
IPv6 uses the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process before using a unicast address to make sure that no other node on that link is already using the address. Hosts use DAD not only at the<br>
end of the SLAAC process, but also any time that a host interface initializes, no matter whether using SLAAC, DHCP, or static address configuration. When performing DAD, if another host already<br>
uses that address, the first host simply does not use the address until the problem is resolved.<br>
a host sends an NS message for its own IPv6 address. No other host should be using that address,<br>
so no other host should send an NDP NA in reply. However, if another host already uses that address, that host will reply with an NA, identifying a duplicate use of the address.<br>
Hosts do the DAD check for each of their unicast addresses, link-local addresses included, both<br>
when the address is first used and each time the host’s interface comes up.<br>
NDP Summary<br>
NDP does more than what is listed in this chapter, and the protocol allows for addition of other<br>
functions, so NDP might continue to grow over time. For now, use Table 25for the four NDP features discussed here. -3 as a study reference</p>
<p>This chapter covers the following exam topics:<br>
1.0 Network Fundamentals<br>
1.1 Explain the role and function of network components<br>
1.1.d Access Points<br>
1.11 Describe wireless principles<br>
1.11.a Nonoverlapping Wi-Fi channels<br>
1.11.b SSID<br>
1.11.c RF</p>
<p>Comparing Wired and Wireless Networks</p>
<p>Wireless devices must adhere to a common standard (IEEE 802.11).<br>
Wireless coverage must exist in the area where devices are expected to use it.<br>
Wireless LAN Topologies<br>
IEEE 802.11 WLANs are always half duplex because transmissions between stations use the same frequency or channel.</p>
<p>Basic Service Set<br>
before a device can participate, it must advertise its capabilities and then be granted permission to join. The 802.11 standard calls this a basic service set (BSS). At the heart of every BSS is a<br>
wireless access point (AP),<br>
The AP operates ininfrastructure mode,which meansit offers the services that are necessary to<br>
form the infrastructure of a wireless networkchannel. The AP and the members of the BSS must all use the same channel to communicate. The AP also establishes its BSS over a single wireless<br>
properly.</p>
