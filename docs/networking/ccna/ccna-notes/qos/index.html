<p>4.7 Explain the forwarding per-hop behavior (PHB) for QoS such as classification, marking, queuing, congestion, policing, shaping</p>
<p>QoS defines these actions as per-hop behaviors (PHBs), which is a formal term to refer to actions other than storing and forwarding a message.</p>

<p>Bandwidth</p>
<p>refers to the speed of a link, in bits per second (bps)</p>
<p>helps to also think of bandwidth as the capacity of the link, in terms of how many bits can be sent over the link per second.</p>
<p>Delay</p>
<p>the time between sending one packet and that same packet arriving at the destination host</p>
<p>Round-trip delay</p>
<p>the time it takes to send one packet between two hosts and receive one back</p>
<p>Jitter</p>
<p>variation in one-way delay between consecutive packets sent by the same application</p>
<p>Loss</p>
<p>the number of lost messages, usually as a percentage of packets sent.</p>
<p>people think of loss as something caused by faulty cabling or poor WAN services. That is one cause. However, more loss happens because of the normal operation of the networking devices, in which the devices’ queues get too full, so the device has nowhere to put new packets, and it discards the packet.</p>

<p>Quality of Experience (QoE) - users’ perception of their use of the application on the network.</p>
<p>Voice and Video Applications</p>
<p>A flow is all the data moving from one application to another over the network, with one flow for each direction</p>
<p>For example, if you open a website and connect to a web server, the web page content that moves from the server to the client is one flow.</p>
<p>From a voice perspective, a phone call between two IP phones would create a flow for each direction</p>
<p>Step 1. The phone user makes a phone call and begins speaking.</p>
<p>Step 2. A chip called a codec processes (digitizes) the sound to create a binary code (160 bytes with the G.711 codec, for example) for a certain time period (usually 20 ms).</p>
<p>Step 3. The phone places the data into an IP packet.</p>
<p>Step 4. The phone sends the packet to the destination IP phone.</p>

<p>QoS as Mentioned in This Book</p>
<p>“Classification and Marking” is about the marking of packets and the definition of trust boundaries.</p>
<p>“Queuing” describes the scheduling of packets to give one type of packet priority over another.</p>
<p>“Shaping and Policing” explains these two tools together because they are often used on opposite ends of a link.</p>
<p>“Congestion Avoidance” addresses how to manage the packet loss that occurs when network devices get too busy.</p>
<p>Classification and Marking</p>
<p>a type of QoS tool that classifies packets based on their header contents then marks the message by changing some bits in specific header fields</p>
<p>Classification Basics</p>
<p>QoS tools sit in the path that packets take when being forwarded through a router or switch, much like the positioning of ACLs. Like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled on an interface. Also like ACLs, QoS tools are enabled for a direction: packets entering the interface (before the forwarding decision) or for messages exiting the interface (after the forwarding decision).</p>
<p>classification refers to the process of matching the fields in a message to make a choice to take some QoS action</p>
<p>QoS tools perform classification (matching of header fields) to decide which packets to take certain QoS actions against. Those actions include the other types of QoS tools discussed in this chapter, such as queuing, shaping, policing, and so on.</p>

Figure 11-3 Big Idea: Classification for Queuing in a Router &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>Matching (Classification) Basics</p>
<p>Cisco and by RFCs, suggests doing complex matching early in the life of a packet and then marking the packet. Marking means that the QoS tool changes one or more header fields, setting a value in the header.</p>

<p>Classification on Routers with ACLs and NBAR</p>
<p>many QoS tools support the ability to simply refer to an IP ACL, with this kind of logic:</p>
<p>For any packet matched by the ACL with a permit action, consider that packet a match for QoS, so do a particular QoS action.</p>
<p>All these fields are matchable for QoS classification.</p>

Figure 11-5 Classification with Five Fields Used by Extended ACLs &ldquo;&gt;</p>
<p>not every classification can be easily made by matching with an ACL. In more challenging cases, Cisco Network Based Application Recognition (NBAR) can be used. NBAR is basically in its second major version, called NBAR2, or next-generation NBAR. In short, NBAR2 matches packets for classification in a large variety of ways that are very useful for QoS.</p>
<p>NBAR2 looks far beyond what an ACL can examine in a message</p>
<p>Cisco also organizes what NBAR can match in ways that make it easy to separate the traffic into different classes.</p>
<p>you might classify WebEx traffic and give it a unique DSCP marking. NBAR provides easy built-in matching ability for WebEx, plus more than 1000 different subcategories of applications.</p>
<p>NBAR refers to this idea of defining the characteristics of different applications as application signatures.)</p>

<p>Marking the IP Header</p>
<p>Marking a QoS field in the IP header works well with QoS because the IP header exists for the entire trip from the source host to the destination host.</p>
<p>IPv4 defines a Type of Service (ToS) byte in the IPv4 header, as shown in Figure 11-6. The original RFC defined a 3-bit IP Precedence (IPP) field for QoS marking. That field gave us eight separate values—binary 000, 001, 010, and so on, through 111—which when converted to decimal are decimals 0 through 7.</p>

<p>Those last 5 bits of the ToS byte per RFC 791 were mostly defined for some purpose but were not used in practice to any significant extent.</p>
<p>DSCP increased the number of marking bits to 6 bits, allowing for 64 unique values that can be marked. The DiffServ RFCs, which became RFCs back in the late 1990s, have become accepted as the most common method to use when doing QoS, and using the DSCP field for marking has become quite common.</p>
<p>IPv6 has a similar field to mark as well. The 6-bit field also goes by the name DSCP, with the byte in the IPv6 header being called the IPv6 Traffic Class byte.</p>
<p>Marking the Ethernet 802.1Q Header</p>
<p>marking field exists in the 802.1Q header</p>
<p>It goes by two different names: Class of Service, or CoS, and Priority Code Point, or PCP.</p>
<p>sits in the third byte of the 4-byte 802.1Q header, as a 3-bit field, supplying eight possible values to mark (see Figure 11-7). It goes by two different names: Class of Service, or CoS, and Priority Code Point, or PCP.</p>

<p>Most often QoS plans use EF to mark voice payload packets. With voice calls, some packets carry voice payload, and other packets carry call signaling messages. Call signaling messages set up (create) the voice call between two devices, and they do not require low delay, jitter, and loss.</p>
<p>By default, Cisco IP Phones mark voice pay-load with EF, and mark voice signaling packets sent by the phone with another value called CS3.</p>
<p>Assured Forwarding (AF)</p>
<p>The Assured Forwarding (AF) DiffServ RFC (2597) defines a set of 12 DSCP values meant to be used in concert with each other</p>
<p>defines the concept of four separate queues in a queuing system. Additionally, it defines three levels of drop priority within each queue for use with congestion avoidance tools. With four queues, and three drop priority classes per queue, you need 12 different DSCP markings, one for each combination of queue and drop priority. (Queuing and congestion avoidance mechanisms are discussed later in this chapter.)</p>
<p>The text names follow a format of AFXY, with X referring to the queue (1 through 4) and Y referring to the drop priority (1 through 3).</p>

<p>A Prioritization Strategy for Data, Voice, and Video</p>
<p>approach queuing in their QoS plans:</p>
<p>Key Topic.</p>
<p>Use a round-robin queuing method like CBWFQ for data classes and for noninteractive voice and video.</p>
<p>If faced with too little bandwidth compared to the typical amount of traffic, give data classes that support business-critical applications much more guaranteed bandwidth than is given to less important data classes.</p>
<p>Use a priority queue with LLQ scheduling for interactive voice and video, to achieve low delay, jitter, and loss.</p>
<p>Put voice in a separate queue from video so that the policing function applies separately to each.</p>
<p>Define enough bandwidth for each priority queue so that the built-in policer should not discard any messages from the priority queues.</p>
<p>Use Call Admission Control (CAC) tools to avoid adding too much voice or video to the network, which would trigger the policer function.</p>

<p>a 200-Mbps committed information rate (CIR).</p>
<p>the SP providing the WAN service agrees to allow the enterprise to send 200 Mbps of traffic in each direction. However, remember that the enterprise routers transmit the data at the speed of the access link, or 1 Gbps in this case.</p>
<p>The SP can police incoming packets, setting the policing rate to match the CIR that the customer chooses for that link.</p>
<p>Policers can also re-mark packets.</p>
<p>SP could mark the messages with a new marking value, with this strategy:</p>
<p>Re-mark packets that exceed the policing rate, but let them into the SP’s network.</p>
<p>If other SP network devices are experiencing congestion when they process the packet, the different marking means that device can discard the packet. However…</p>
<p>…if no other SP network devices are experiencing congestion when forwarding that re-marked packet, it gets through the SP network anyway.</p>
<p>SP can treat their customers a little better by discarding less traffic, while still protecting the SP’s network during times of stress.</p>
<p>key features of policing:</p>
<p>Key Topic.</p>
<p>It measures the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured policing rate.</p>
<p>It allows for a burst of data after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>It is enabled on an interface, in either direction, but typically at ingress.</p>
<p>It can discard excess messages but can also re-mark the message so that it is a candidate for more aggressive discard later in its journey.</p>
<h2 id="shaping">Shaping</h2>
<p>Use a shaper to slow down the traffic</p>
<p>shaping before sending data to an SP that is policing—is one of the typical uses of a shaper</p>
<p>slows messages down by queuing the messages.</p>
<p>then services the shaping queues, but not based on when the physical interface is available</p>
<p>schedules messages from the shaping queues based on the shaping rate</p>
<p>the shaper queues packets so that the sending rate through the shaper does not exceed the shaping rate; and then output queuing works as normal, if needed.</p>

<h3 id="setting-a-good-shaping-time-interval-for-voice-and-video">Setting a Good Shaping Time Interval for Voice and Video</h3>
<p>you can (and should) configure a shaper’s setting that changes the internal operation of the shaper, which then reduces the delay and jitter caused to voice and video traffic.</p>
<p>A shaper’s time interval refers to its internal logic and how a shaper averages, over time, sending at a particular rate</p>
<p>Because the interface transmits bits at 1 Gbps, it takes just .2 seconds, or 200 ms, to send all 200 million bits. Then the shaper must wait for the rest of the time interval, another 800 ms, before beginning the next time interval.</p>

<p>Tc = .01 second (10 ms): Send at 1 Gbps for 2 ms, rest for 8 ms</p>
<p>When shaping, use a short time interval. By recommendation, use a 10-ms time interval to support voice and video.</p>
<p>key features of shapers:</p>
<p>Key Topic.</p>
<p>Shapers measure the traffic rate over time for comparison to the configured shaping rate.</p>
<p>Shapers allow for bursting after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p>Shapers are enabled on an interface for egress (outgoing packets).</p>
<p>Shapers slow down packets by queuing them and over time releasing them from the queue at the shaping rate.</p>
<p>Shapers use queuing tools to create and schedule the shaping queues, which is very important for the same reasons discussed for output queuing.</p>
