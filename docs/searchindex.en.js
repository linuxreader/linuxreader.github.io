    "content": "This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.\nSummary and Highlights Being sick and tired is a result of a skewed pain/pleasure balance. In order to find balance, you must understand the relationship between pleasure and pain in the body. Pleasure and pain operate in the same area of the brain and are intertwined.\nCompulsive consumption leads to pain. And we all can face consumption issues. Even if we have good lives.\nThere are many factors that increase risk for over consumption and addiction. These include:\nBiology Mental illness Trauma Genetics Poverty “Limbic capitalism” is the market force that profits on consumption. This provides access to hyper novel and more potent substances and behaviors. More than any time in history.\nEven the internet suggests behaviors that we would have not thought of doing in the first place. Porn and TikTok come to mind. We see crazy behaviors as “Normal” because other people on the internet are doing them.\nThe rush is never as good as you imagine.\nKids these days are growing up in padded environments and not ready for the real world. We have made them afraid of adversity and are encouraging hedonism and escapism.\nWe can’t even put up with minor discomforts like being bored. We are always seeking out novelty and entertainment.\nGo 30 minutes a day with nothing but your thoughts. This will help you become familiar with yourself, others, and the world. You are no longer running from painful thoughts and emotions.\nBoredom can be terrifying. It makes you think about big issues, meaning, and purpose. Boredom is an opportunity. You may discover something new. It gives your mind space to think.\nYou may attribute fatigue and the inability to focus to mental illness. But it could also be from sleep deprivation, over consumption, and over stimulation.\nThe reason we are so miserable is because we are trying so hard not to be miserable.\nWhy too much pleasure leads to pain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in reward processing. It plays a bigger role in the motivation to get a reward than the pleasure of having the reward.\nThe brains reward pathway includes these parts of the brain:\nVentral tegmental Nucleus accumbens Prefrontal cortex The more/faster dopamine released from a drug or behavior, the more addictive the drug or behavior is.\nPleasure and pain function as a balance in the brain. When one side of the balance is weighted down, the brain compensates by pushing down on the opposite side. Pleasure leads to pain, pain leads to pleasure.\nThe brain wants to maintain homeostasis.\nOpponent process theory states that any prolonged or repeated departures from hedonic or effective neutrality have a cost.\nWith prolonged exposure to pleasure, our capacity to tolerate pain decreases, and our threshold for experiencing pleasure increases.\nThe negative feedback caused by tolerance Repeated exposure to a pleasure stimulus makes the pleasure from that stimulus less and less. And the rebound to the pain side gets stronger and longer. You need more of a behavior or substance over time to feel the same amount of pleasure.\nOver time, your baseline gets set to the side of pain, as your brain tries to counteract bigger and more potent doses of pleasure. See how this bird starts out normal and healthy, then eventually needs it’s drug just to feel normal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUngLgGRJpo\nPeople who do Opioids for a long time often experience more pain not less. This is referred to as “opioid induced hyperglasia”.\nHeavy and prolonged dopamine leads to a baseline that is dopamine deficient. Hedonism leads to ahedonia.\nUniversal symtoms of withdrawl include:\nAnxiety Irritability Insomnia Dysphoria The pain from withdrawl is what drives people to relapse, withdrawl is the pleasure/pain balance tipping towards the side of pain.\nIf you wait long enough, you can reset your dopamine baseline. (in most cases) And you can regain pleasure in simple things like going for walks, listening to birds, reading, writing, watching the sun rise, etc.\nDopamine cues Cue dependant learning or pavlovian conditioning is when dopamine is released in the brain in response to a conditioned cue. This leads to pleasure in anticipation of a reward. When the cue happens, dopamine drops below baseline, which leads us to seek out the reward.\nDopamine levels below baseline drive craving. The cycle of craving can occur outside of conscious awareness. Dopamine levels raise once we get the reward, but falls below baseline if the reward doesn’t happen.\nLoss chasing: when the uncertainty of getting a reward is as reinforcing as the reward it self. Like gambling or likes on social media.\nThese conditioned reward pathways can cause permanent brain changes. But new pathways can always be forged with dopamine-healthy activities like human connection or exercise.\nEven learning releases dopamine.\nBalance is person independent. Pleasure and pain can happen at the same time like with spicy food. Something that one person finds pleasurable or painful may not be the same for someone else. And not everyone starts with a level balance.\nPeople injured in war are sometimes in less pain because they are pulled into a safer environment when they are being treated.\n“We are Cacti in a rainforest” -Dr. Tom Finucane. Our brains have evolved for a world of scarcity, but we live in a new world of abundance.\nDopamine Fasting We must abstain from the unwanted behavior in order to truly have clarity on how it effects us. High dopamine substances or behaviors cloud our ability to see cause and effect. And young people are more immune to immediate negative impacts than adults.\nHere are 8 steps to a dopamine fast:\nGet information on the details of your dopamine use. What, when, how often? Find out your personal reason for doing the dopamine inducing behavior. Even seemingly irrational behavior is often rooted in personal logic. What problems is the drug or behavior causing? Short term? Long term? Go for a set period without the drug or behavior. Use mindfulness to observe your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations as separate from yourself. Abstaining gives new insight to the behaviors. Decide if you will continue using in a controlled way. Or go completely without. Experiment to find out what works and what doesn’t. “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired”\nDo you want to be doing this 10 years from now? How about 5? 1? 6 months from now? You may as well try to stop now. Consider your current behaviors for your future self.\nYou must go without the drug or behavior in order to reset your dopamine baseline and to truly see the cause and effect between substance use and how you feel.\nYou can’t replace one drug with another because you will still be weighing down the pleasure side of the balance. And something less potent won’t feel like a reward because your baseline for pleasure is too high.\nIf you don’t feel better after a dopamine fast then you may have some other underlying medical problem. But you will feel worse before you feel better. Withdrawal can last anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months or longer.\nUse mindfulness to observe without judging yourself. Have compassion for yourself. The thoughts and emotions you have been running from will come crashing down on you during withdrawal. Instead of running, tolerate it.\nDon’t forget that moderation can backfire.\nLimit access through self-binding. Self-binding is placing barriers between you and the reward to help get over the limitations of willpower. Willpower gets tired the more we use it. This is a tool, not a fail safe.\nYou do self binding while your will is strong. Not when the cue, routine, reward cycle has already started and your willpower goes down.\nMake it harder to access the reward.\nThis can be through physical barriers or distance. Such as a ksafe or weight loss surgeries. It can also be based on time limits and finish lines. Such as setting a time of day to use or a reward for accomplishing something.\n“Forgive yourself, you have problems like everyone else.”\nTrack your usage to become more aware. Overall awareness will help mitigate consumption.\nDelay discounting is when high dopamine messes with our ability to delay gratification. “Temporal horizons” shrink when we are under the spell of a drug. You become governed by the pleasure-pain balance, instead of by reason. You can no longer objectively evaluate immediate rewards vs their long term counterparts.\nIf you don’t take control now, you may be doing this forever.\nThe opposite is also true, immediate rewards activate emotion and reward parts of the brain. When you delay rewards, you activate the prefrontal cortex. Which is involved in planning and abstract thinking.\nCategorical self binding is avoiding anything that could entertain your addict mind. Like how scrolling Instagram can lead to seeking out porn. Sort dopamine into categories. Ones that you will allow yourself to consume, and ones you do not. This helps avoid triggers that lead to craving.\nThis is useful for substances that we can’t eliminate all together but want to have a healthier relationship with like food, sex, smartphones, etc.\nThis can fail if you accidentally include a triggering behavior in your list of acceptable behaviors.\nYou can also transform an object into a symbol of restraint. Such as putting a single beer on display to remind you of what you are doing.\nRather than feeling restrained by this new way of living, you will feel liberated.\nIntimacy from drugs doesn’t last.\nThere are drugs may help with addictions, but have the potential to become addictive themselves. Prescription stimulants like Adderall are the molecular equivalent to meth. They cause huge spikes of dopamine and have high high potential for abuse.\nThese drugs could also potentially make things worse in the long run and have unintended consequences.\nADHD drug treatment is associated with deterioration in academic and social-emotional functioning.\nAntidepressants may lead to tolerance and dependence and make depression worse in the long run (tardive dysphoria).\nInstead of feeling better than well, these drugs may make us feel other than well. And can limit our ability to experience the full range of emotions needed for a balanced life.\nWe may be making large portions of the population indifferent to intolerable circumstances. Corporations and governments have the potential to use drugs as a form of social control.\nThere are as many as 10,000 toddlers receiving stimulants like Ritalin.\nWhen you are numb to everything, you lose your hunger for anything. Medications can be lifesaving, but there are other tools than can help.\nWhy you should lean on pain We feel great after a cold shower. The first seconds are painful, tell yourself this is temporary.\nJames bond shower: Start with a normal shower, then end it cold for at least a minute.\nDopamine and norepinephrine levels rise 250 and 530% above baseline respectively. And remain elevated hours after. And have been shown to raise serotonin and neuronal growth.\nPressing on the pain side of the balance can lead to pleasure. The dopamine that results is indirect and potentially longer lasting. Just like how the body restores balance by leaning toward pain after a pleasure stimuli, the body will restore balance towards pleasure from a painful stimuli.\n“With intermittent exposure to pain, our natural hedonic set point gets weighted to the side of pleasure, such that we become less vulnerable to pain and more able to feel pleasure over time.” -pg 145 Dopamine Nation\nSocrates on the relationship between pain and pleasure:\n“How strange would appear to be this thing that men call pleasure! And how curiously it is related to what is thought to be its opposite, pain! The two will never be found together in a man, and yet if you seek the one and obtain it, you are almost bound always to get the other as well, just as though they were both attached to one and the same head. . . . Wherever the one is found, the other follows up behind. So, in my case, since I had pain in my leg as a result of the fetters, pleasure seems to have come to follow it up.” -pg 147 Dopamine Nation\nHormesis Using pain to treat pain has been around forever.\nHormesis is the study of using small doses of “pain” to trigger the body’s adaptive processes. (Cold, heat, gravitational changes, radiation, food restriction, exercise, etc.) These adaptive processes improve tolerance and functionality of the system to harder challenges.\nIntermittent fasting in animals increased life span, reduced blood pressure, and improved Heart Rate Variability.\n“Exercise is immediately toxic to cells, leading to increased temperatures, noxious oxidants, and oxygen and glucose deprivation. Yet the evidence is overwhelming that exercise is health-promoting, and the absence of exercise, especially combined with chronic sedentary feeding—eating too much all day long—is deadly.”\nExercise increases many of the neurotransmitters involved in positive mood regulation: dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, endocannabinoids, and endogenous opioid peptides (endorphins). Exercise contributes to the birth of new neurons and supporting glial cells. Exercise even reduces the likelihood of using and getting addicted to drugs.\" -pg 150 Dopamine Nation\nDopamine and movement are deeply connected. Do obtain what we desire, we need to go get it. Do drugs just remind us that we have bodies?\nExercise is more beneficial to positive mood, sleep, cognition than any pill. Even a 30 minute walk is beneficial. Just remember that pleasure comes AFTER pain.\nThe extreme side of pain can cause it’s own addiction. So be careful. Too much pain can deplete dopamine, causing overconsumption. So just slightly lean into pain. Build progress over time.\nTruth telling Telling the truth is another “pain leads to pleasure”. You can trick yourself when you are lying. So you are inhibiting self-awareness as well when you tell the truth. Writing in a journal is a good way to master yourself with truth telling.\nDenial is caused by the disconnect between our reward pathway and higher brain regions. (Prefrontal cortex)\nPrefrontal cortex is involved in planning, storytelling, decision making, emotional regulation, etc.\nTelling the truth activates the prefrontal cortex and strengthens it through repeated use.\nAwareness What behavior or habit do you want to change? Why? And what would you be giving up if you stopped that behavior? What is one step you can take to change the behavior?\nHonesty makes connections with other humans We assume people will abandon us when we expose our vulnerabilities. But they really assure other people of their own doubts, fears, and weaknesses.\nHuman connection increases Oxytocin. Oxytocin binds to dopamine-secreting neurons and enhances the reward circuit tract. Human connection replaces addiction.\nConsuming leads to isolation. Because you replace the reward you get from Human connections with artificial rewards.\nHuman connection can be exploited as an addiction as well. When it is used for selfish gratifications rather than through shared humanity. Like when people are Grandstanding and manipulating.\nDo not share stories about your addictions to show off. Only share them to teach lessons. Tell accurate stories about yourself. Do not play the victim. Take responsibility. Accurate stories help you make accurate decisions.\nWrite down your character defects and ways those hurt your relationships.\nSocial media has led us to creating false self’s about what our lives are really like. If we don’t feel real, we isolate and become depersonalized.\nHonesty tethers ourselves to reality and makes us feel real in the world.\nGetting control of your addictions can lead others to do the same.\nKeep your promises to children. The children benefit and are better able to regulate their emotions.\nPeople will feel more confident around you because they can trust you.\nProsocial Shame Destructive shame is when the group condemns or shuns when someone makes a mistake. Over consumption leads to shame, which leads to lying, which leads to isolation, which continues the circle to over consumption.\nProsocial shame is when the group holds us closer and provides steps to redemption. It says that shame is useful for thriving communities. We all have our flaws and need forgiveness. Instead of leading to lying, it leads to truth telling and acceptance and breaks the cycle of addiction.\nIf we are open and honest to our children about our mistakes and struggles, children will be more open and honest with us about theirs. Admit when we have been wrong.\nWe feel deeply connected to others when we feel accepted despite our flaws.\nSocial media makes us compare ourselves to the entire world. Leading us to believe we should have done more.\nImmerse ourselves in the world instead of turning away from it.\nFinding balance does not happen instantly. It requires patience, courage, and maintenance. You must have faith that the small actions you take every day will pay off in the future.\nIf you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback. I want to become a better writer and help others grow along with me. Feedback is invaluable for this goal.\nThanks for reading!",

    "content": "Sex drive is a powerful force. And misusing it brings you down to the level of an animal. You must conserve and transmute this force to reveal your true gifts. Feeding lust makes you never satisfied, and spills over into all other areas in life. Giving a low rating because it’s overly religious for my tastes. And says that if you have sex, then you won’t have guy friends because you are afraid of being gay. Other than those two things, it’s a decent intro on the benefits you can experience from controlling your sexual side.\nSummary and Highlights Sexual nature spirals out of control, always moving towards chaos the more it is indulged.\nLust is like a drug. Caries the negative traits of other drug addictions.\nLust makes you more materialistic. Clinging to the physical world, and abandoning the spiritual one.\nWomen notice a man change after a man releases. His mood changes. He becomes uninterested in her. He becomes withdrawn. He loses the sparkle in his eye.\nWhen retaining sexual energy, a man becomes more noble, acquires patience, magnanimity, energy, and strength.\nHe becomes kinder to his children and has more patience with them.\nOrgasm gives man a “Male Period”.\nOrgasm more than once a month makes man psychologically inferior to a woman.\nSemen benefits women physically and psychologically.\nRetaining sexual energy is the foundation of character and psychological resilience.\nWithout masculine energy, females are having to fill that role in families and society.\nWith woman taking over masculine roles and feminine roles, she does neither one good.\nCultivate your sexual energy in order to stop your decline. Each day adding more benefits than the previous.\nWhen you retain you become more patient.\nYour mind becomes steady.\nYou get your fidelity back.\nYou become more calm and generous.\nYou become less needy.\nSex no longer controls you.\nAny attempt to cut back on orgasms gives benefits.\nYou become more charming.\nYou get “superpowers”\nYou get psychological improvements.\nYour greatness is based on your ability to control your sexual nature.\nWhen you try to control your sexual energy and fail, you are still better than the person who does not try and says that there is no reason to try.\n“No man is great who doesn’t have righteous control of his sexual energy.”\nYour ability to be moral depends on the control you have over your sexual nature.\nSexual purity is everything, the more sexually pure you are, the more moral impact you have on the world. The less sexually pure you are, the worst moral impact you have on the world.\nLust is a cheap thrill that has nothing to do with you.\nIt has nothing to do with divine bliss and does not compare.\nCelibacy becomes easy.\nCelibacy means there is no loss of creative substance. No lust.\nIt is not just retaining semen that is important.\nEvery effort at celibacy gives you permanent effect.\nSexual desire makes you a slave.\nSexual addict will rationalize to keep the addiction going. They will try to get others to become addicted for their own “lustful stimulation” and too provide a validating environment.\nLust is an empty, fruitless pursuit that draws you away from the spiritual world, and down to “matter” or the physical world.\nYou must make an effort to banish lustful thoughts.\nYou can take a vow or not. But stay on the path either way.\nYou are not signing up for “The death of all pleasure”.\nYour health gets better, you get more energy, you need less sleep, you have more power to manifest your thoughts.\nYou can achieve deeper meditation.\nMore wealth.\nSex is not a human need. It is a force of nature.\nMan strives to attain authority over forces of nature.\nYou cannot satisfy a sex appetite. You are led to the nature of a beast.\nSex is not a drug to make you feel better or temporarily distract you from pain.\nSex is intended to make babies.\nSex is not a way to build power or give you influence.\nSex is not meant to make you famous or make money.\nSex is not meant for bonding. It is just using each other as a drug.\nYou need vitality, strength, and endurance.\nYou need evenness and patience.\nKnowledge builds like compound interest in a celibate.\nYou need meditation.\nMeditation is stabilized by celibacy.\nEnlightenment is only possible through celibacy.\nQuit losing your vital force.\n“Tantra” tries to include the world in the divine.\nSexuality disturbs us and takes away our peace.\nSex draws us away from the spiritual world, and out into the material world. Giving the illusion that the material world is real and important.\nHigher divorce rate is seen in nations that have the most sex in marriage.\nSex cheapens relationships and makes you lose respect for each other.\nRespect each other’s good character to achieve higher bonding. Divine friendship.\nFriendship is the highest form of human relationships.\nA meditation practice makes all material addictions (including sex) decline and then disappear.\nBecause Meditation brings superior pleasure than sense pleasures of the body.\nWhen you retain, stavic qualities arise. You want to serve mankind. You get charisma.\nWhen you sex, your life becomes darker and less successful on all levels.\nAll human sexual perversion comes from indulging in lust.\nMost human sorrow comes from lust.\nThis is a hard reality to grasp and few can bare it.\nYou can achieve limitless bliss of pure consciousness.\nEven just a little bit of Caffeine makes it nearly impossible to stay on the path.\nKeep the mind on lofty thoughts, exercise strenuously, meditate, serve others. And your sexual energy will by transmuted into physical strength, health, creativity, and bliss.\nVirtue brings beauty, sin brings ugliness.\n“Yoga” means “union” with the divine.\n“Yoga Sutras” by Patanjali.\nAn austerity is a “doing without.” Austerity and Renunciation are the same thing.\nBuddha was a Hindu. The books he read were the Bhagavad-Gita and the Vedas.\nYou must have austerity to develop spiritually.\nThe eight parts of yoga. - Self restraints - Fixed observances - Posture - Regulation of breath - Abstraction - Concentration - Contemplation - Trance\n“The Science of Yoga, The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali” with Commentary by I.K. Taimni, p. 205.\nFive Yamas (Forms Of Restraint): - Bramacharya (Sexual Celibacy) - Ahimsa (Non-Injury) - Satya (Truth) - Asteya (Abstention From Stealing) - Bramacharya (Continence) - Aparigraha {Abstinence From Avariciousness)\nSanskrit is the oldest language.\nSanskrit is a literal language not open to interpretation.\nBramacharya refers to one thing, and one thing only: sexual celibacy. No orgasms, at minimum. No thought of sex or sexual titillation.\nDo no look at breasts or rear ends of women as they go by.\nEventually the energy will stop dropping to your private parts when you look at women.\nDo not imagine having sex with any woman.\nVirya = vigor\nYou attain virya.\nWeakness, laxity (not caring), and inadequacy disappear.\nYou gain resilience, strength, and energy.\nEventually, even the slightest thought of sex fails to enter the mind.\n“Yoga Vasistha,” by the sage Vasistha, is one of the most valuable books on yoga.\nCelibacy is the sole means to one’s ultimate good.\nThe only way to master your mind.\n“Lovingly, patiently wean yourself away from sense addictions.”\nSex weakens you, makes you an addict, and gives you delusional notions that keep you trapped.\nSex addicted men do not win wars or battles. They cannot even mount an effective resistance.\nBanish all fear and weakness. Never weaken your mind by thinking of past mistakes.\nNever lose faith in yourself.\nFrom lust comes grief, from lust comes fear; he who is free from lust neither sorrows nor fears.\nThe thirst of a heedless man grows like a creeper; he runs from life to life, like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.\nSufferings fall from him like water drops from a lotus leaf.\nCalled a medicant (sanyyasin).\nHe who, though richly adorned, exercises tranquillity, is quiet, subdued, restrained, chaste, and has ceased to injure all other beings, is indeed a Brahman, an ascetic, a friar.\nThere are no satisfying lusts.\nEver by a shower of gold pieces; he who knows that lusts have a short taste and bring suffering in their train is wise.\nFour things befall the heedless man who courts his neighbor’s wife – first, acquisition of demerit, secondly, an uncomfortable bed, thirdly, evil report, and lastly, hell.\nThe type of Buddhism spreading most in America is Tibetan Buddhism, or “Tantric Buddhism”.\nAny sexual self restraint has great benefits to man morally, emotionally, and physically, and conduces to all prosperity.\nEngine of enlightenment.\nMakes possible the deeper meditation.\nSteadies the mind.\nAny sexual self-restraint\" gives “great benefits” to man.\nIt is more difficult to attain celibacy and sexual self restraint for a male.\nWhen he attains it, the effects on him are immediately greater.\nIn bodily terms, the woman is the actual winner in the sex act; the male is the actual loser.\nIn the spiritual path, one disengages from grosser pleasures so that one can experience pleasures that are finer and more satisfying.\nThe one thing worth attaining.\nIncreased energy and greater powers of concentration.\nProper attitude one should have toward wickedness is to ignore it, while praising the virtuous.\nCelibacy has always been, and still is, essential to classical yoga.\nThe sanskrit term for sexual celibacy is bramacharya. For a man it means no emission of sexual fluid. This is the minimum meaning for celibacy. Celibacy has been broken, for example, if a man has an orgasm in sleep.\nHe fully burns up all thoughts of sex, starting with the gross physical mind, and then later cleaning up his dream states and astral mind.\nYogananda states that meditation is the highest of all the austerities.\nThe renunciation of harmful food, useless diversions, fruitless pleasures.\nShe seems to lack his energy, intrepidness, intelligence, skill, and courage.\nWhen he first finds attraction to another female, again, it is to the eyes and face. His shakti dwells in the higher part of the spine.\nThe orgasm has indeed made him less interested in society, less able to deal with the stresses of other people, and even antisocial.\nHe can fill up this strange new emptiness with a distraction or thrill.\nDivine Shakti becomes insulted and angry seeing herself “dumped on the ground” for no procreative purpose. She regrets that she gave that boy the sexual organ and the sexual power of the male. The Divine Shakti begins taking steps to mess up the boy’s life, and darken his world.\nAs the boy keeps sexing, a coarse energy or pollution gathers in his lower chakras, casting a blight on his outer world.\nIf he doesn’t have clear moral teachings or guidance on this subject, from people he loves and respects, he won’t adequately reject this activity and will be tempted to do it again.\nOther men, especially males, are in the best position to protect him here. Without clear warnings and teachings/dharma from another male he respects, he does it again and begins to develop an addiction to it.\nFirst he had no interest in the idea of the sex act. In fact as a boy the sex act seemed stupid and disgusting. But now it is interesting and the idea gives a sexual charge.\nThis marks him, giving him powerful samskaras (memories/impressions) of sex. Later as he tries to renounce, these impressions will become deeply problematic. The memories of sex will keep coming back to him, inciting his lust.\nHis eyes now have the habit of looking at the bodies of women and lusting.\nThe male developing sex addiction is always drawn to look at the bodies of women. Women on the street, women at school, women at work, etc.\nBut now his consciousness is dropping lower. In society, this causes women to become preoccupied with a new part of her body, her butt.\nWomen in more pure societies are never obsessed about their butts.\nYou can tell where a society is at in it’s decline by which part of the anatomy the female is most obsessed about.\nThe male becomes powerless in his reaction to the female form.\nEvery time he sees the female form, in photos or it life, he is intensely drawn to it. The female body has a seemingly magical hold over him, and his response to the female form is intense.\nThe female form becomes his true idol, his de facto god.\nHe is easily irritated, and easily loses his temper, especially after an orgasm.\nPowers of focus and concentration lessen.\nBecomes less competent and energetic in discharging his duties.\nHe has less patience and operates from a lower morale.\nHe is more likely to get into conflicts and arguments with others, and operate from a less noble emotional position.\nHe performs more other deeds which are unvirtuous, destructive, or negative.\nListless and lacks sparkle. He lacks energy. He is sick more. He may develop a chronic health problem.\nUsually the sexing man comes to be more comfortable relating to women, and is uncomfortable with men.\nFeels uncomfortable getting close to men, and avoids men as friends.\nMen no longer appeal as companions, because he relates to others mostly with a sexual charge, and he has become so sexualized that it begins to respond to strange things, as if sexual desire had an omnivorous appetite.\nYou can usually tell a man who is fairly sexually clean, because he will have close non sexual male relationships, even preferring to be with men, with no sexual thing at all.\nHe begins to find himself attracted to things in the woman that did not have a sexual meaning before.\nHe is about to take the path of the demon, who is destined to be made fertilizer by the Divine Being.\nA sexual thrill will begin to develop around increasingly perverse and disturbing things. With each new collapse, he yields something more in the realm of his conscience and values.\nMan either moves into the darkness of sexual perversion, or realizes where he is headed and turns back in the direction of his original purity.\nMost effective technique for regaining this lost purity is outright sexual renunciation, along with deep meditation.\nMeditation is critically important, because it gives a more-than-ample replacement of the lost pleasure when pursued devoutly.\nSteps along the way as he reverses his path:\nConscious realization that what he is doing is wrong and destructive in his life. He has become aware of becoming in some way sexually corrupted or perverted. He realizes he is addicted and begins to seek for help in some form.\nIt is good for the male to ask, in a conscious way, a higher power to intervene and assist him in overcoming the addiction.\nThe higher power might be termed God, Jesus Christ, or another guru. He makes a statement to himself of renunciation. Like a smoker who throws all his cigarettes in the sewer, he accomplishes an act of renunciation.\nBegins to make an effort not to look at sexual things, read sexual things, or listen to sexual things, or go to women where does sexual things. Because of this effort he reduces his orgasms, but he will probably continue to slip regularly. When he does slip, he feels increasing remorse and disgust with himself. He prays more about the problem.\nIf the man is fortunate, he will find activities that substitute for the pleasure being given up. He will begin to turn the energy now saved to more constructive and positive activities. This may be involvement with people or service. It may be one of the arts. He may throw himself into writing a book, or reading and learning He may get obsessed with his car or some other vehicle, or begin some new interest. If he is very fortunate, he will discover meditation. This will eventually completely short circuit the sex addiction.\nAs he sexes less, any trend toward perversion begins to recede. He strips back the years and regains his more simple, healthy sexual interests.\nThings that were once gross but had become interesting, now are gross and repugnant again. Small and wholesome matters become sexually attractive again, such as the sight of a woman’s calf, or the shape of her bust, or her downy cheek.\nRestraint. He feels more sexually potent, and the attraction to women at times is quite strong. This occasionally causes him to slip again. As a once sexually active man attempts restraint, he naturally builds up a higher level of sexual potential.\nHe comes into states in which he feels more potent than ever.\nAt times, as this energy is building up but not transmuted, he feels so virile he thinks he could be a veritable stag, mating with many women. He can find sexual attraction to even the plainest of women at these times. He feels like his sexual energy is some kind of boon or precious gift he has to bestow. (This is true, but he should not let it trick him into the Deed.)\nThis is a lot of fun for him to feel this potent, so he will occasionally slip. Like a sailor who has been away at sea for months, sex desire becomes keen again, and he will at times savor it and “ride” it as he once did when he was younger and becoming addicted.\nThis is a mistake, but most men will go through phases like this. The stored up sexual energy is still inclined to want to go down through the lower.\nHe is trying to pen up a wild stallion that is used to running free. He has a tiger in the barn, and for a period it seems to be problematic.\nEventually the horse will be like a powerful, disciplined draft horse that can be applied to any task.\nBut during the beginning, the horse wants to bolt a lot. Because of the storing of the sexual energy, any fanning of the flame makes the man feel extremely passionate desire. What he has inside him seems more powerful than before.\nWith cultivation the tiger will become calm and serve you.\n(Thinks that) “Celibacy must be impossible or bad. It makes men very horny.” But the fellow is only in an unbaked stage of unskilled celibacy.\nThe man has a long way to go yet. When he does slip, he will feel more remorse than ever.\nAnd like an alcoholic, he will also find that he sinks to the old depths rather quickly. Whereas his sexual appetite had seemed so wholesome, now a perverse thought reappears. This happens after a slip. Channels have been “cut” in the body, brain, and astral body by the addiction and experiences of the past. These channels are still fresh. Weeds may be growing up in what was once a highway, but the path is still there. In Hinduism these impressions or markings are called “samskaras.” If you scratch a mark in the ground, water will tend to find that channel and flow down it.\nJust abstaining and letting them lie fallow for a while doesn’t erase them. They are quickly reclaimed and reactivated with every lapse back into sexing.\nThere will be lapses. But the wise man continues to cultivate himself away from sexing. He may find he can will the sexual energy to bolt up up his spine. When doing so, his spine will bolt erect, as if his whole upper body had become an erection. He stops looking at the butts of women and their other physical features. When he does look, he feels a little disappointed by what he sees.\nIt’s just the same old butt. He starts to think, “You see one, you’ve seen them all.”\nHis most tempting sexual encounters begin to be in the dream state. He sees fewer women who attract him.\nAs he begins to purify himself of lust, he begins to sense lust in others.\nMost women begin to seem used and soiled, or having lust. He senses these things by instinct.\nBecause he is becoming pure, he notices the impurity in others.\nHe finds that he is only attracted to those with some purity.\nHe no longer consciously masturbates; only in near sleep or sleep states.\nHe becomes keenly aware of how any loss of semen weakens him physically and demoralizes him. He may masturbate consciously or semi-consciously, but endeavors not to “leak” any semen.\nHe may experiment with Taoist\" sexual practices in which sexual pleasure is indulged, but semen is retained or drawn back in. These cause harm to the sexual organs such as the prostate, plus keep him sexing and addicted to the thrill.\nHe sees how even the mental activity of lusting is vitiating and drains him of shakti.\nHe senses how even when he looks at a woman with lust, he is losing subtle shakti.\nNow we have a man capable of becoming that jewel among men, the celibate.\nVirya refers to noticeable qualities of character and countenance that come to the celibate male (In some Sutra translations the English word “vigor” is used instead).\nVirya means the increase of masculine qualities such as strength, stamina, energy, clarity, patience and evenness.\nHis body, face and attitude.\nHe wins wars, and protects others who are more vulnerable. Virility also makes a man unafraid.\nIn the “Art of War” there is given this interesting strategy for winning a war: Send prostitutes into the enemy camp.\nSturdy, intrepid, and forceful.\nThe first evidence of a man’s progress in spiritual life is a strong grit.\nWhat “grit” means: Firmness of character, especially in pain or danger.\nUnrestrained and wanton sex destroys the character of man and takes away his courage.\nTejas (effulgence) Tejas refers to the sparkle in the eyes and, the glow of vitality, and charismatic aura around the face and body of a celibate saint or yogi.\nYou are sick less often. Many health problems will be mitigated, or disappear entirely. You need less sleep.\nDevelop a more even temperament.\nFew things irritate you or cause you to lose your temper.\nYou are bolder, more courageous, and show integrity.\nDevelop consistency of character and more constancy in pursuing goals.\nEven begin controlling “wet dreams”.\nWhen any come close to attracting you, it will always be a woman who is herself developing moral purity.\nYou no longer create sexual experiences in the dream state. One begins to see the female form in a different way.\nYou begin seeing that almost all women assume males are no better than dogs, that all men inherently worship the female form, and that men are generally unable to resist any woman who gives them half a chance.\nWomen who are conventionally “sexy” will not attract this sort of man unless they have high moral virtue similar to his.\nSo it is that as men return to purity and goodness, women automatically follow.\nOthers notice you and are attracted to you more than before, especially women.\nHappens to be attracted to the stored up sexual energy itself, which provides greater temptations to the celibate, and to her.\nAs a man withdraws energy from the lower centers and the sexual organ, sometimes a buzzing or vibrating sensation can be felt in the sexual members. This carries no erotic or sexual feeling.\nThis is the divine shakti knocking off layers of dark karma associated with that organ.\nYou stop having erections, even in the dream state.\nRequires abstention from all caffeine.\nA sign of spiritual development is a more pleasant and attractive voice.\nYour words are found to have more effect. Your thoughts are found to influence your surroundings. People who spend time around you become more like you. Whatever spiritual realization you have, you become able to pass it to others.\nOne result is usually a heightened interest in God and pursuit of the spiritual life.\nEven a celibate man who is not a God-seeker will influence others powerfully through his thoughts.\nThe buildup of the male energy, manifests as more energy.\nEndurance, steadiness, toughness, and courage – in all areas of life.\nWasting of the male substance eventually makes a man weak, listless, timid, and feminine.\nPlace in the human brain associated with sexual orgasm. This area lies next to the part of the brain associated with violent aggression. As the sexer repeatedly “overheats” this part of the brain, it begins to fuse with the violent-aggressive part of the brain. Thus the sexer eventually finds that he is getting erections at the sight of blood and violence. We have a term from deep in our cultural history: “blood lust”.\nDesire for celibacy does not often emerge in the female as compellingly as in a man who finally figures out the situation. First of all, sex desire tends not to become such a problem for the female, causing such negative consequences.\nAny man who sexes more than once a month is automatically inferior to any woman.\nA female yogi directing her shakti up the spine over a long time will eventually cease from having her period.\nMany great female saints having the highest station of nirvikalpa samadhi. Examples: St. Teresa of Avila, Ananda Mayi Ma, the living saint Karuna Mayi.\nThe man is inherently rajasic, pushing outward and also manifests his spiritual progress more noticeably in the external realm.\nTypical Male Weaknesses –Addiction to the Female Form; tendency to become addicted to sex –Lack Of interest in the spiritual and esoteric –Addiction to activity and worldly pursuits, Overly aggressive, combative nature.\nHurtfulness towards others which clouds his karma and hides from him the spiritual truth –Pride, ego, arrogance, lack of humility. –Fruitless intellectuality; tendency to become distracted by too many facts, details, and fine distinctions, Difficulty grasping the broad, ineffable, inarticulate sense of things –Enjoyment of arguing over spiritual things; lording spiritual knowledge over others –Less capacity for trust and Faith (shraddha) –More distance from the childlike consciousness –Less tendency for emotion and devotion (bhakti) –Tendency to believe in only external things –Tendency to view external things as more important, including in external things in the spiritual and religious fields. The male is the leader in the attraction to worldliness.\nTendency to silence, economy of words, which conserves his life force and reduces his entanglements, improving his sadhana.\nWhen the male, for a long time, worships the female form, the female will necessarily come to worship her own form.\nWoman has long been dismayed, bemused and even confused by the power of her body to hold such sway over the male.\nNothing in the material world, and no sensual feeling, can ever satisfy man because man is Spirit.",
    "description": "Sex drive is a powerful force. And misusing it brings you down to the level of an animal. You must conserve and transmute this force to reveal your true gifts. Feeding lust makes you never satisfied, and spills over into all other areas in life. Giving a low rating because it’s overly religious for my tastes. And says that if you have sex, then you won’t have guy friends because you are afraid of being gay. Other than those two things, it’s a decent intro on the benefits you can experience from controlling your sexual side.",

    "content": "Don’t argue with your kids. Manage behavior without getting angry. This was an exciting method at first but became un-managable. Focuses too much on last resort when all other methods fail. Instead of focusing on the all other methods. Very easy to use “breaks” and rewards to try and manipulate your child instead of teaching lessons and trying to get activities to be enjoyable in and of themselves. Read Playful Parenting instead.\nSummary and Highlights The 3 jobs for you as a parent Control obnoxious Behavior (STOP behaviors) Encourage good behavior (START behaviors) Strengthening your relationship with your children. Controlling obnoxious behavior (STOP Behaviors) This is where counting and break times come in. You will use counting and break times for STOP behaviors.\nTaking Breaks and Counting A break is when parents and child can separate briefly so they can calm down and regroup. You do not talk about the behavior after the break. No need to punish the child twice. If the behavior was dangerous, unusual, or new, then give a brief explanation.\n3 counts are needed before a break occurs. And after you’ve tried ignoring, sympathetic listening, distraction, and joint problem solving.\nYou and your child may fall for the arguing/ yelling/ hitting/ persuading/ defending/ rationalizing trap. You need to start counting before this happens. Once you notice that you’ve fallen in this trap. Simply go back to counting.\nThe parents tone should not be anger/ negative. It should simply be “I love you but you simply cannot behave this way”.\nStraight to 3! Major behavior goes straight to 3 and taking a break. This is stuff like hitting, spitting, etc. Still, you must be gentle and consistent. Then the child’s behavior will mature over time.\nYour child won’t behave rationally when they are upset. Same goes to you! The brain is just not wired that way. When dealing with a child, you must manage the yelling/ screaming/ whining/ fighting. All while encouraging positive behaviors like eating, doing homework, cleaning up, going to bed and child/parent bonding.\nTo be an effective parent you must be gentle and friendly. The message your child receives should be that you love them and will take care of them.\nYou must also balance this with being firm and letting them know that you expect them to do something.\nChildren also will model your behavior. Like if you solve problems with anger. They will to. If you are calm and collected. They will learn that from you as well.\nCounting is for STOP behaviors You must control negative behaviors. These are things you want your children to STOP doing. And what you will use COUNTING for.\nPhysical attacks on people , breaking something, fighting Teasing Whinin Temper (intimidation, “I HATE YOU!”) Arguing Badgering (wearing you down with repetition Tantrums Yelling Threat (I’m running away from home) Martyrdom (“I never get anything”) Crying, pouting, looking sad on purpose Saying something is unfair Butter up “you are the nicest dad in the world!” Promises/ insincere apologies This is controlling obnoxious behavior. Or the demanding side of parenting. This teaches you and your child to hold back and avoid dysfunctional responses.\nMethods for stop behaviors. Counting Go straight to 3 if behavior is dangerous or extreme. Don’t talk or get angry, just count. Voice should be casual but stern. No extra talking or emotion. Things should go back to normal after a count. Counting with anger is challenging your child to misbehave. Both parents can be involved in any of the counts (mom says 1 for first offense dad says 2, etc.). Keep quit and ignore for minor offenses (depending on your fuse). When in doubt count Take about 5 seconds between counts Start the counting cycle over longer as the child gets older. (15 minutes for 5 year old, 2-3 hours for an 11 year old, etc. Do not punish bad grades, use the reward system for grades instead. Explain to child the counting process when you first start. Should not be used for bedtime. Break time One minute per year of the child’s life. Do not make eye contact or talk to child. Remain gentle but firm and instructive. You do not have to close the door. No lectures, explanations, or emotions after a break time. Explanations are appropriate when the behavior is new, unusual, or dangerous. Very gentle procedure to calm everyone down. If child behaves, praise him and enjoy his company, if they do something else that is countable, count it. Parent should not be furious, yelling, lecturing, or physical or emotionally abusive. Most failures are because the parent forgets the no talking and no emotion rules. Timer doesn’t start until child is done with tantrum (unless they are 3 or younger, then just let them out when their time is up, start the count over if they continue to misbehave after they get out). Child can go to room and read, take a nap, play legos, draw, etc. No phone, no friends, and no electronic entertainment. Use same strategy if company is over. Send kid and friend outside if they both get counted to 3. Give child a hug after break time if they want one. Should happen right when the offense happens. Do not give a break time an hour later for something. If you can’t give a breaktime right away then use a breaktime alternative. What if kids won’t go to break time?\nBring them to the room. Choose a breaktime Alternative (you can give them a choice between a couple consequences, you pick if they won’t). Reverse break time, you leave the room, walk around the house, don’t talk. If they won’t come out of breaktime, that is okay, just tell them when their time is up. What if they leave their room?\nAdd extra time. Switch to break time alternative. Doorknob cover. Locking the door. Tell them if they come out then the door gets closed. Break Time Alternatives Make sure these are fair and reasonable. And that the punishment fits the behavior.\nLoss of privilege or toy for a period of time. bedtime fifteen minutes earlier. forty cents off the allowance. no electronic entertainment for two hours. Earlier bedtime. No dessert or treat. No use of phone. No friend over. No conversation—fifteen minutes. Removal of DVD, iPod. Reduced computer time. Loss of TV for evening. Loss of electronic games—two hours. Monetary fine. Small chore—wash bathroom sink. Larger chore—weed yard. Write a paragraph. (Limited only by your imagination) If a child has a fit when dropping off at daycare. Become master of the quick exit. Kiss goodbye, tell them when you’ll see them again, and get out of there. The more you talk, the worse you will make the situation.\nSibling rivalry? Never ask “what happened?” Count both kids. Put them in different break time locations.\nTantrums? Never talk or argue with a tantruming child.\nCommon mistakes when dealing with a misbehaving child Mistake #1\nUsing counting for Start behavior (for example, counting a child to get her to do her homework).\nMistake # 2\nToo much talking.\nMistake #3\nToo much emotion.\nEncourage good behavior. (START behaviors) This takes more effort on the parent AND the child. Cleaning up after themselves. Going to bed on time. Being polite. Doing homework. Warm and demanding side of parenting.\nYou do not count for these things. Instead, to encourage positive action, pick something from this list of methods. You can use one or a combination of these:\nPraise Timers Natural Consequences Docking Charting Counting variation Simple requests Model behavior yourself Make activity fun or add diversions or friendly challenges Positive reinforcement Cheering and applauding, praise Elaborate for younger kids, heartfelt for older kids Praise in front of other people Unexpected praise Three positive comments for every negative comment Simple requests “It’s time to start your homework” Phrasing requests in a “matter of fact” tone Try not to spring requests out of the blue, give them some warning Structure tasks into fixed routines Kitchen timers The docking system If you don’t work, you don’t get paid Charge them money for doing their chores Natural consequences Let the big bad world teach lessons for you “I’m sure you’ll do better next time!” (offer encouragement) 3-4 things to work on at one time for a chart If they do good at something on a chart for a long period of time then replace it with something new Offer rewards for completing a chart Trip for icecream Tokens Small toy Rent a game Outing with parent Shopping trip Sleepover Game with parent No-chore voucher Camping in the backyard Card for a collection Tech time Breakfast in bed Cash Rent a movie Grab-bag surprise Comic book or magazine Friend over for supper Choice of three reinforcers Reading a story with parents Sleeping with the dog or cat Special phone call Collection items Helping make and eat cookies Using a power tool Staying up an extra 15 minutes Counting Variation for start behaviors that only take a couple minutes to accomplish.\nChildren’s approximate capacities at different ages for doing independent school work:\nAge 6: 10 minutes Age 7: 20 minutes Age 8: 30 minutes Age 9: 40 minutes\nStrengthening your relationship with your children Make sure screen time does not replace face-to-face time. You value enjoying each other’s company. Critical for family well-being and child’s self-esteem that you like them and not just love them. Strategies for Strengthening Your Relationships:\nPractice sympathetic listening Avoid over-parenting Join in one-on-one fun Solve problems together If encouraging positive behavior in kids requires more motivation from the kids, it’s also going to require more motivation from Mom and Dad.",

    "content": "The cycle of caffeine addiction can be vicious. Just like any other drug.\nThe cycle goes like this:\nCaffeine causes a variety of pains and withdrawal symptoms. \u003e You use caffeine to relieve these pains and withdrawal symptoms. \u003e Caffeine causes pains and withdrawal symptoms.\nUnless you can break this pattern. You will be trapped in this cycle forever. How do you break the cycle?\nHere are 4 options for breaking the cycle. Along with the benefits and drawbacks for each.\n1. Cold turkey - dealing with the pains and withdrawal symptoms. (Suck it up!) This options requires mental toughness and discipline. If you take this path. You are fed up with caffeine and are all in on quitting. You may have had an event that pushed you over the edge. You’ve had enough.\nYou may also realize that trying to wean off may be harder because you are feeding the addiction cycle.\nYou are immediately stepping out of the cycle. This is the fastest way to quit. But many relapse when the pressure is too great to continue.\n2. Tapering - slowly lower your dose so that the cycle fades away without noticing. (Easy does it!) This option lets you continue to live a normal life. If you have to function at work or at home (or both), this may be a good option. You pick a time frame. Whether it be a few days, or 6 months. Pick an option that you think you can stick with.\nThis option may, however, lead to “serial tapering”.\nThis is where you do a good job weaning for a week or a few days or whatever. But then, due to normal life circumstances, you have a stressful day, a short deadline, a bad night of sleep, or a combo of many different things. And you default to solving this problem with caffeine.\nYour dose ends up being reset to where you started, or worse, higher.\n3. Replacing routines - finding other ways to resolve the pain. (Now we are talking!) In the book “Atomic Habits”, the author explains the cycle of cue, craving, routine, reward. The cue is the thing that triggers the craving, which leads to performing a routine, which is what gets you the reward. For caffeine, this could look like:\nCue = You are tired, but you need to get stuff done at work.\nCraving = You start to crave caffeine.\nRoutine = You take caffeine.\nReward = You feel “Energy” and get your work done.\nWith replacement theory, you replace the routine, to get the exact same reward.\nCue = You are tired, but you need to get stuff done at work.\nCraving = You crave caffeine.\nRoutine = You go on a run.\nReward = You feel “Energy” and get your work done.\nThe trick is, finding a routine to replace caffeine can be difficult. Because there are actually so many factors in the cue to begin with.\nIn my experience, a caffeine-cycle withdrawal cue looks more like this:\nCue = You have anxiety, are slightly down, have brain fog, you feel pressure to get work done, or chores, dealing with back pain, lack motivation, etc.\nCraving = You crave caffeine.\nRoutine = You take caffeine.\nReward = All of the cues, which are just a myriad of withdrawal symptoms, paired with normal life stress, are temporarily resolved.\nWhich leads me to the best option..\n4. A combination of all three (Super Saiyan!) How can you combine cold turkey AND tapering? Well, by definition you can’t. But if you merge the two, you dramatically shorten the time frame of your taper. I believe this could give you some serious momentum. Let’s break down this combo, as well as adding routine replacement:\nMeet in the middle of cold turkey and tapering to do a short, two week taper.\nFind new replacements for all of your cues.\nDuring your two week taper, write down a list of all of your cues. Then write 2-3 ideas on how to solve them.\nHere are some examples:\nCue New Routine Tired Jog, exercise, drink water Bored Pursue a new hobby or skill, read, go on a walk Feeling Down Journal, exercise, watch a inspiring video Achy Joints Stretch, mobility work, massage Anxiety Meditate, Journal, Talk to friends Hungry Drink water, Fill up with fruits and veggies, exercise Stressed Meditate, work on solving problems, support group These may be different for you. But the point is, relentless pursuit of actually solving your problems, and living a fulfilling life. Instead of masking issues with caffeine.\nI think this option is the best bang for your buck. As you are not negating the impact that withdrawal has on your life, but still dealing with any underlying problems you may face when fully caffeine free.\nNotes on the half life of caffeine. The average half life of caffeine is 5 hours. This means, if you consume 500 mg of caffeine, in 5 hours you will still have 250mg of caffeine in your system. 5 hours after that, you will have 125mg. Screw it, i’ll make a chart:\nHour Caffeine in your body (mg) 0 500 5 250 10 125 15 62.5 20 31.2 25 15.6 30 7.8 35 3.9 40 1.9 The half life of drugs can be misleading. Just because the half life is 5 hours, doesn’t mean that the drug will be clear in 10 hours. As you can see, a single dose of caffeine can technically still be in your system more than 40 hours later. And that’s just accounting for the average half life.\nThe high end can be up to 9.5 hours. This means, it can take more than 72 hours for caffeine to fully leave your system after a single dose.\nBut wait, there’s more..\nEach subsequent dose adds to the amount of caffeine in your blood system. You are likely going to start some form of mild withdrawals at the 24 hour mark. And most of us have a daily caffeine habit. This means at 24 hours, if you take another 500mg of caffeine, your new starting point is 515mg.\nIf you take caffeine daily, you ALWAYS have caffeine in your system.\nI don’t want to do anymore math, but as you can see, your caffeine levels will drop more rapidly the higher the dose. So your tapering, in theory, could get faster without feeling the same withdrawals from lowering a higher dose.\nKeep that in mind.",

    "content": "Quick read about creating the business (and life) that you want. These lessons spill over into other areas of life, maybe accidentally. Life isn’t all about maximizing profits and accelerated growth. Do what makes you happy. Treat your customers like rock stars and they will tell everyone.\nSummary and Highlights A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work. Hopefully no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple. A quick glance and common sense should tell you if the numbers will work. The rest are details.\nSuccess comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what’s not working.\nNo plan survives first contact with the customer.\nBy not having any money to waste, you never waste money.\nNever forget that absolutely everything you do is for your customers.\nMake every decision — even decisions about whether to expand the business, raise money, or promote someone — according to what’s best for your customers.\nThe way to grow your business is to focus entirely on your existing customers. Just thrill them, and they’ll tell everyone.\nYou need to confidently exclude people, and proudly say what you’re not. By doing so, you will win the hearts of the people you want.\nYou can’t pretend there’s only one way to do it. Your first idea is just one of many options.\nNo business goes as planned, so make ten radically different plans. Realizing the initial choice you made was just one of many.\nYou don’t need a plan or a vision.\nJournalists would ask, “What’s your long-term goal?”\nI’d say, “I don’t have one. I surpassed my goals long ago. I’m just trying to help musicians with whatever they need today.”\nSo please don’t think you need a huge vision. Just stay focused on helping people today.\nHow do you grade yourself?\nIt’s important to know in advance, to make sure you’re staying focused on what’s honestly important to you, instead of doing what others think you should.\nNever forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing.\nAre you helping people?\nAre they happy?\nAre you happy?\nAre you profitable?\nIsn’t that enough?\nAll bad service comes from a mindset of scarcity. They act like they’ll go out of business if they don’t fiercely guard their bottom line. The short-term thinking of desperate survival blocks the long-term thinking of smart strategy.\nIf you really feel secure and abundant — that you have plenty to share — then this feeling of generosity will flow down into all of your interactions with customers.\nGive refunds. Give them attention. Take a little loss. You can afford it.\nLosing 25 cents on extra sauce can mean winning the loyalty of a customer who will spend $1000 with you over the next ten years, and tell twenty friends that you’re awesome.\nIt’s all about them, not you.\nThe Tao of business: Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you’ll do well.\nIf you set up your business like you don’t need the money, people are happier to pay you.\nWhen someone’s doing something for the money, people can sense it, like a desperate lover. It’s a turn-off.\nWe want to give to those who give.\nPeople will choose one company over another just because they like the customer service.\nCustomer service is not an expense to be minimized. It’s a core profit center, like sales. It’s where you should put your best people.\nIt’s much harder to get a new customer than it is to get more business from an existing customer.\nTake a few inefficient minutes to get to know anyone who contacts you.\nImagine what you’d do if your favorite rock star called. You’d drop everything, and give them all the time in the world. So that’s how you should treat everyone that contacts your company.\nWhy not? You don’t have time? Make time. It’s how everyone deserves to be treated.\nIt makes life better. It makes work more fun. And it’s the right thing to do.\nBut the best thing to do is to lose the fight. Let them know that they were right, and the company was wrong. Tell them you’re prepared to do whatever it takes to make them happy again.\nLoud people are loud people, whether complaining or praising. So when you get some loud complaint, use that opportunity to make them so happy that they become a loud evangelist.\nWhen one customer wrongs you, remember the thousands that did not.\nIt’s often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you.\nIn the end, it’s about what you want to be, not what you want to have.\nDoesn’t every business want to be as big as possible?\nNo. Make sure you know what makes you happy, and don’t forget it.\nTrust, but verify.\nRemember it when delegating. You have to do both.\nAbdicate means to surrender or relinquish power or responsibility.\nThis word is usually used when a king abdicates the throne or crown.\nDelegate, but don’t abdicate.\nEntrepreneurs, “How do you know when it’s time to sell?”.\nMy answer is, “You’ll know\".\nI live simply. I don’t own a house, a car, or even a TV. The less I own, the happier I am. The lack of stuff gives me the priceless freedom to live anywhere anytime.\nWhy you need your own company:\nWe all need a place to play.\nThose of us with business ideas? We need a company.\nNot for the money, but because it’s our place to experiment, create, and turn thoughts into reality. We need to pursue our intrinsic motivation.\nWe have so many interesting ideas and theories. We need to try them!\nThe happiest people are not lounging on beaches. They’re engaged in interesting work!\nSome want to be famous in Silicon Valley. Some want to be anonymous.\nNo matter which goal you choose, there will be lots of people telling you you’re wrong.\nJust pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Pay close attention to when you’re being the real you and when you’re trying to impress an invisible jury.\nEven if what you’re doing is slowing the growth of your business — if it makes you happy, that’s OK. It’s your choice to remain small.",

You start out at a healthy balance. But before you know it. You are trapped in an addictive cycle.\nDISCLAIMER: YOU MAY NOT FEEL ANY NEGATIVES OF CAFFEINE UNTIL YEARS OF USE!!\nOr.. you may not associate the negatives that are currently happening with caffeine. This is because there is a disconnect with the immediate response to caffeine and the negatives it brings.\nHere’s how it goes:\nYou take caffeine through your medium of choice. (Some even go for the suppository… Coffee ENEMAS anyone?)\nYou think, “Caffeine is great”. Look at all your new “energy, adrenaline rush, tomato!”.\nYou wake up the next morning. Dreary and weary. Can’t get out of bed. Let’s get some of that caffeine to make you feel better.\nAnd the cycle repeats. You associate your dreary wearies with getting old. Your lack of sleep is because you just suck at sleeping. Your fits of irritability are just your personality.\nYour joint pain is your poor posture, not the fact that you no longer have the energy to maintain a good posture, because caffeine is sucking the life out of you.\nTake a look at this advertisement from 1924 mentioned in Eugene M. Schwartz’s famous book “Breakthrough Advertising”:\nWHY MEN CRACK.. .\nAn authority of international standing recently wrote;\n“You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar . . . “\nYou know them. Strong men. Vigorous men, robust men — men who have never had a sick day in their lives.\nThey drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves over the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash.\nYou have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.\n“He was such a healthy-looking man “\nHe was. His health was his undoing. His constitution absorbed punishment. Otherwise he might have been warned in time.\n“For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction.” You learned the law in physics. It applies to bodies.\nFor every ounce of energy gained by stimulation, by whipping the nerves to action, an ounce of reserve strength is drained . . .\nBut repeated withdrawals exhaust any reserve.\nPhysical bankruptcy. Then the crash . . .\nIt’s time to get back to normal, to close the drafts, to bank some of the fires…\nAvoid stimulants. What is good for the boy is good for the man . . .\nBorrowed Energy Must Be Repaid!\nTwo million American families avoid caffeine by drinking Postum.\nAnd two million American families are better\noff for it. . .\nPeople knew this was a problem 100 years ago. Yet, we are all still addicted.\nCaffeine is the #1 ignored factor when it comes to health. Here is the “advice” we see over and over again in regards to taking control of your physical health:\nCut carbs. Cut out blue light. Don’t eat past 6. Don’t eat uncooked spinach. Eat only meat. Stop eating unsoaked almonds. Take this supplement. 80% of Americans consume some form of caffeine daily. I’ve seen mothers give their toddlers Mountain dew! Almonds are the problem? What world are we living in?\nWe are so obsessed with minor details that we miss the obvious. Seriously, anyone who is recommending putting butter in your coffee for optimal health has no clue what optimal health is.\nPeople are clueless about caffeine. Why?\nBecause it’s “Normal”.\nIt’s a problem that is hard to see before it’s too late.\n“But caffeine is not a problem for me.”\nAny amount of stimulants in your body is a problem. It’s effecting you today. If you want to feel breadth of emotions again, have unlimited energy throughout the day, have healthy joints, be able to recover fully from exercise, have the most creative thoughts you can possibly have…\nYou need to quit caffeine. Plain and simple. You are not living the life you are fully capable of.\nStudies showing caffeine is “Healthy”. Really think about it. Would you believe studies about cocaine funded by cocaine dealers or done my cocaine addicts that think cocaine gives them a positive lift?\nThere is a billion dollar industry that thrives off of you believing this nonsense. And the mildness of the drug and normalization make many people never second guess it.\nThe science is not as bleeding edge as we think. Especially when it comes to nutrition. Caffeine is not a vitamin. We need to start relying a little bit more on human intuition then studies funded by big caffeine and drug addicts.\nIs caffeine stopping us from living the lives we truly want? Here’s the #1 post on Reddit regarding caffeine:\nIt’s Not Withdrawal. Your Career Just Sucks\nI’m a software developer, about a year and a half caffeine-free. Immediately after quitting, my productivity at work plummeted. It hasn’t returned to pre-caffeine levels since.\nI have realized that this is not due to withdrawal, but rather because I cannot, as a human being, sit in front of a screen all day, toiling away at meaningless work for a soulless corporation. Caffeine played a pivotal role in hiding this reality. With caffeine, I can slog through all manner of tedium and even have fun. Without it, I feel a strong attraction to a “stop and smell the roses” mode of living. I go on long walks, look at trees, write poetry, and I don’t get jack shit done at work.\nI can breathe. My sleep is perfect. My digestion is perfect. My livelihood, however, is in jeopardy. I just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone has quit caffeine but is struggling with productivity or lack of motivation: It’s not withdrawal. You’re a spiritual creature in a cold, mechanical system, and now there’s no hiding.\nThere is something deeper going on here. Is caffeine used as a form of control? I mean, the Nazi’s gave prisoners soup, bread, and coffee for a reason right?\nCaffeine is a worker bee drug. It makes you a slave and complacent. It numbs your prefrontal cortex just like any other drug.\nThis screws with your ability to delay gratification and makes you seek out more short term rewards to numb the pain.\nI go over the pain-pleasure balance in my Dopamine Nation summary. So I won’t re-hash it here.\nBut the pain-pleasure balance is important to understand. Once you do. You will realize that putting anything in your body that is not food or water is making you miserable.\nCaffeine is a gateway drug. Imagine this..\nYou are anxious, on edge, irritable, depressed, have trouble sleeping. You think this is just you. You reach for alcohol or weed or Kratom or whatever to take the edge off. You were only in that state because of caffeine.\nThis scenario may not have happened to you yet. But I guarantee it has happened to millions of people who have turned towards drugs to numb the pain.\nCaffeine kills people, tips people with deadly heart disease over the edge, plays a factor in road rage car accidents, causes vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cardiac arrhythmia, perpetuates drug addiction, and much more.\nIt’s poison.\nWhen are we going to wake up?",

    "content": "We must separate the child from the behavior. Often, when a child’s behavior appears as “bad”, it’s really the child having a big emotion that they can’t regulate in a controlled way. Offers helpful tips on every day parenting struggles. Another parenting book that will give you a good frame of mind when thinking about your kids, but as I put this to practice, there are still challenging times where I have no idea what I am doing as a parent.\nSummary and Highlights “What is my child struggling with and what’s my role in helping them?”\nMove from a place of “What’s wrong with my child and can you fix them?” to “What is my child struggling with and what’s my role in helping them?” And hopefully also, “What’s coming up for ME about this situation?”\nWhile I resist time-outs, punishments, consequences, and ignoring, there’s nothing about my parenting style that’s permissive or fragile. My approach promotes firm boundaries, parental authority, and sturdy leadership, all while maintaining positive relationships, trust, and respect.\nPractical, solution-based strategies can also promote deeper healing.\nYou can be firm and warm, boundaried and validating, focused on connection while acting as a sturdy authority.\nSeeing your child as good inside does not excuse bad behavior or lead to permissive parenting.\nUnderstanding that we’re all good inside is what allows you to distinguish a person (your child) from a behavior (rudeness, hitting, saying, “I hate you”).\nDifferentiating who someone is from what they do is key to creating interventions that preserve your relationship while also leading to impactful change.\nWe are evolutionarily wired with a negativity bias, meaning we pay closer attention to what’s difficult with our kids (or with ourselves, our partners, even the world at large) than to what is working well.\nWhen parents chronically shut down a behavior harshly without recognizing the good kid underneath, a child internalizes that they are bad.\nFinding the good inside can often come from asking ourselves one simple question: “What is my most generous interpretation of what just happened?”\nFocusing on a child’s impact on us sets the stage for codependence, not regulation or empathy.\nFinding the MGI (Most Generous Interpretation) teaches parents to attend to what is going on inside of their child (big feelings, big worries, big urges, big sensations) rather than what is going on outside of their child (big words, or sometimes big actions).\nAt all times, but especially when our kids are dysregulated—meaning their emotions overwhelm their current coping skills—they look to their parents to understand, “Who am I right now? Am I a bad kid doing bad things . . . or am I a good kid having a hard time?” Our kids form their own self-view by taking in their parents’ answers to these questions.\nIf we want our kids to have true self-confidence and to feel good about themselves, we need to reflect back to our kids that they are good inside, even as they struggle on the outside.\nIn a family system, some roles are prioritized over others. Safety comes before happiness and before our kids’ being pleased with us. First and foremost, our job is to keep our children safe, physically and psychologically.\nThere’s nothing scary to a child as noticing when their parent fails at this job (especially when that failure stems from a parent’s fear of their kid’s reaction).\nThe child receives the subconscious message: when you are out of control, there’s no one capable of stepping in and helping you.\nOf course, your kid won’t thank you for stepping in and keeping them safe, but I promise you, that’s what they’re looking for, because it’s what allows them to build the emotion regulation skills they need to grow into a healthy adult.\nIn this two-story-house analogy, the parent is, basically, a staircase. Their primary function is to start linking a child’s downstairs brain (overwhelming feelings) to their upstairs brain (self-awareness, regulation, planning, decision-making).\nBoundaries are not what we tell kids not to do; boundaries are what we tell kids we will do. Boundaries embody your authority.\nBoundaries are not what we tell kids not to do; boundaries are what we tell kids we will do.\nValidation is the process of seeing someone else’s emotional experience as real and true, rather than seeing someone else’s emotional experience as something we want to convince them out of or logic them away from.\nTwo psychological models that address the relationship between parent and child: attachment theory and internal family systems.\nAttachment Theory Children who figured out how to keep an attachment figure nearby—literally, physically close to them—were more likely to receive comfort and protection, which meant they were more likely to survive, while children who had more distance from an attachment figure were less likely to receive comfort and protection, and thus were less likely to survive.\nChildren create different types of attachment based on their early experiences with caregivers. The type of attachment that is formed impacts that child’s internal working model—the thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions, and behaviors that influence how they interact with themselves and others, and what types of relationships they seek out in later years.\nInternal working models are based on what a child learns, through personal interactions, about their caregiver’s responsiveness, availability, consistency, repair, and reactivity.\nChildren filter our interactions with them based on a handful of questions: Am I lovable and good and desirable to be around? Will I be seen and heard? What can I expect of others when I am upset? What can I expect of others when I am overwhelmed? What can I expect of others when we disagree?\nThey take the answers to these questions and make generalizations about who they are allowed to be and how the world works.\nA child learns that certain feelings are threatening to attachment.\nThat child will then seek to shut down these experiences, likely through the mechanism of shame or self-blame, as his survival literally depends on it.\nHis feelings are real and valid and can be held within close relationships.\nNow, relationships with parents that include responsiveness, warmth, predictability, and repair when things feel bad set a child up to have a secure base.\nThe more children feel they can depend on a parent, the more independent they can be.\nInternal family systems (IFS) Therapeutic model that considers different parts within a person, as opposed to thinking about a person in a singular manner.\nThe language of “parts” allows us to articulate, internally and externally, our conflicting—or at least coexisting—emotions:\nSensations and feelings and thoughts as parts we can relate to, not experiences that take over and consume us.\nUnder the behavior is a child (or in IFS language, a part of a child) who is in pain, has an unmet need, and is in desperate need of connection.\nThe development of the middle prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain involved with emotion regulation, cognitive flexibility, empathy, and connectedness—is influenced by the attachment relationship with a caregiver.\nDestiny—an individual wired for insecure attachment can rewire for secure attachment.\nDestiny—an individual wired for insecure attachment can rewire for secure attachment.\nWhen parents are willing to change, when they are willing to repair and reflect together, nondefensively, about moments in the past that felt bad to kids . . . the child’s brain can rewire.\nA child’s behavior—which is an expression of a child’s emotion regulation patterns—develops in relation to a parent’s emotional maturity.\nChildren who are left alone with intense distress often rely on one of two coping mechanisms: self-doubt and self-blame.\nWith self-doubt, kids invalidate their own experience in an attempt to feel safe in their environment again.\nIt leads to teens and adults who don’t trust themselves and cannot locate intuition. Instead, they use other people’s treatment of them to define who they are and what they deserve.\nSelf-blame\nAllows a child to feel in control, because as long as he convinces himself that he’s a bad kid doing bad things, and that if he was better he would feel more secure . . . well, then he has a viable option to change.\nSay you’re sorry, share your reflections with your child—restating your memory of what happened, so your kid knows it wasn’t all in his head—and then say what you wish you had done differently and what you plan to do differently now and in the future.\n(“Mommy was having big feelings that came out in a yelling voice. Those were my feelings and it’s my job to work on managing them better. It’s never your fault when I yell and it’s not your job to figure out how I can stay calmer. I love you”)\nInstead of insinuating that your child “made you” react in a certain way.\nAs a parent, you are your child’s role model. When your child sees you as a work in progress, he learns that he, too, can learn from his struggles and take responsibility when he acts in a way he isn’t proud of.\nSolid relationships aren’t solid because they lack conflict, they’re solid because the people in them possess the ability to reconnect after disagreements and to feel understood again after feeling misunderstood.\n“Good parents don’t get it right all the time. Good parents repair.”\nWhether you’re repairing something big or small, your children will feel that repair in their bodies, and this moment of connection and explanation will soften the initial memory of aloneness and confusion. The big repairs, the small repairs—they all matter. Every little bit counts.\nResillience \u003e Happiness Cultivating happiness is dependent on regulating distress.\nWe have to feel safe before we can feel happy.\nThe wider the range of feelings we can regulate—if we can manage the frustration, disappointment, envy, and sadness—the more space we have to cultivate happiness.\nThe wider the range of feelings we can name and tolerate in our kids (again, this doesn’t mean behaviors), the wider the range of feelings they will be able to manage safely, affording them an increased ability to feel at home with themselves.\nResilience, in many ways, is our ability to experience a wide range of emotions and still feel like ourselves.\nHelps us bounce back from the stress, failure, mistakes, and adversity in our lives.\nOur resilience determines how we relate to those difficult moments as well as how we experience them.\nstress + coping = internal experience.\nResilience is about developing the capacity to tolerate distress, to stay in and with a tough, challenging moment, to find our footing and our goodness even when we don’t have confirmation of achievement or pending success.\nThe qualities children most need from their parents in order to develop resilience include: empathy, listening, accepting them for who they are, providing a safe and consistent presence, identifying their strengths, allowing for mistakes, helping them develop responsibility, and building problem-solving skills.\nAm I helping my kid tolerate and work through this distress, or am I encouraging my child to avoid and beeline out of the distress?\nThe more we emphasize our children’s happiness and “feeling better,” the more we set up them up for an adulthood of anxiety.\nSetting happiness as the goal compels us to solve our kids’ problems rather than equip them to solve their own.\nBehavior is a Window When we focus too much on judging and changing a specific behavior, we get in the way of that behavior actually changing, because we miss the core struggle that motivated it in the first place.\nBy understanding what motivates behavior, we can help kids build resilience and regulate emotions, which will inevitably lead to behavioral changes.\nWhen we address the behavior first, we miss the opportunity to help our children build skills, and beyond this, we miss the opportunity to see our kids as people rather than a collection of behaviors.\nWhen we approach our kids with charts and reinforcement and stickers and time-outs, we essentially tell them that their behavioral compliance is what matters most. We display an indifference to their distress and their personhood (an interest in which is critical to forming human relationships),\nWhen we sacrifice relationship building in favor of control tactics, our children may age, but in many ways, they developmentally remain toddlers, because they miss out on years of building the emotion regulation, coping skills, intrinsic motivation, and inhibition of desires that are necessary\nWhen our kids get older and bigger, methods of behavior control stop working. Children simply aren’t motivated anymore by our rewards, and they’re too physically big for us to enforce punishments and consequences.\nWhen we sacrifice relationship building in favor of control tactics, our children may age, but in many ways, they developmentally remain toddlers, because they miss out on years of building the emotion regulation, coping skills, intrinsic motivation, and inhibition of desires that are necessary for life success.\nWhen we are busy exerting extrinsic control over our children’s external behavior, we sacrifice teaching these critical internal skills.\nIf we don’t build a sturdy foundation with our kids—one based in trust, understanding, and curiosity—then we have nothing keeping them attached to us.\nconnection capital\nThe reserve of positive feelings we hopefully build up with our children, which we can pull from in times of struggle or when the relationship between us gets strained.\nWe don’t want to ‘craft our child’s behavior’ . . . we want to help our son develop into a good person. We want to understand him, to help him with the things that feel bad to him.\nSome questions to get you started, to ask yourself after any tough moment: What is my most generous interpretation (MGI) of my child’s behavior?\nWhat was going on for my child that moment? What was my child feeling right before that behavior emerged? What urge did my child have a hard time regulating? What is a parallel situation in my life? And if I did something similar, what might I have been struggling with in that moment? What does my child feel I don’t understand about them? If I remember that my child is a good kid having a hard time . . . what are they having a hard time with? What deeper themes are being displayed underneath this behavior?\nReduce Shame, Increase Connection A numb, glazed-over child tends to infuriate a parent, because we think our child is ignoring us, or we misinterpret their behavior as rudeness or apathy.\nAs a result, rather than recognize or address the shame, we yell or get into a power struggle with our kid or send him away to his room—all approaches that escalate the shame and continue the cycle.\nOur goal as parents should be to notice when shame arises in our child, understand what situations bring it up, and see how it presents behaviorally.\nAfter that, we want to develop shame reduction, which enables us to help our children feel safe and secure again. Detect first, reduce second. So how do we do that?\nDevelop shame reduction, which enables us to help our children feel safe and secure again. Detect first, reduce second.\nRefusal to apologize is a classic example of shame: it presents as cold and unempathic when, in fact, in these moments, a child is overwhelmed with “badness” and freezes up.\nWhen a child is overwhelmed with shame, we must be willing to put our original “goal”—to elicit an apology, to inspire gratitude, to prompt an honest answer—to the side and instead focus solely on reducing the shame.\nConnection first. Connection is the opposite of shame. It is the antidote to shame. Shame is a warning sign of aloneness, danger, and badness; connection is a sign of presence, safety, and goodness.\nAnother reason why connection with our children in their difficult moments does not “reinforce” bad behavior: shame has never been a motivator of positive behavior change at any time, in any place, for any type of person. Shame is sticky; it stagnates us. Connection is opening; it allows for movement. Connection is when we show our kids, “It’s okay to be you right now. Even when you’re struggling, it’s okay to be you. I am here with you, as you are.”\nThe more we get to know our own circuitry, learn to tolerate and explore our own distress, and build coping skills for hard feelings, the more present we can be for our children.\nTell the Truth Parents often fear that telling their kids the truth will be too scary or overwhelming, but we tend to have it all wrong when it comes to what scares children. It’s not information so much as feeling confused and alone in the absence of information that terrifies them.\nWhen kids are left to make sense of a scary change on their own, they usually rely on the methods that give them control: self-blame (“I must have done something to cause this. I’m bad, I’m too much”) and self-doubt (“I must have misunderstood the tension around me.\")\nWatching a parent confront hard truths will help a child learn to regulate his feelings.\nConfirming Perceptions\n“________ happened. You were right to notice that.”\nChildren are wired to notice and perceive, so I would assume that even if my child appeared calm, feelings of fear would be living inside his body.\nConfirming our children’s perceptions sets them up to recognize when things don’t feel right later, and it will empower them to trust themselves enough to speak up.\nYou won’t always have answers, but you can always work on feeling safe and competent in the present moment.\nSelf-Care Kids actually feel comforted when parents set firm boundaries around self-care. Parents, after all, are the leaders of the family, and children want a sense of sturdiness and self-assurance in their leaders.\n“I have an opportunity. I can heal things within myself at the same time as I parent my kids in a way I feel proud of. I can do both at the same time.”\nLong out-breaths are key to calming down.\nAcknowledge, Validate, Permit (AVP)\nThe more energy we use to push emotions like anxiety or anger or sadness away, the more powerfully those emotions spring back up.\nRather than avoiding emotions we’d rather not face, we need to make a shift. We need to say to ourselves, “[Anxiety/anger/sadness] is not my enemy. My [anxiety/anger/sadness] is allowed to be here. I can tolerate my discomfort.”\nAcknowledge: Label your feelings.\nValidate: Respect your feelings enough to assume they aren’t lying to you. Now tell yourself a story about why your feelings make sense.\nPermit: Give yourself permission to have your feeling in whatever way it’s showing up.\nWe need cooperation from others, but not approval.\nYou are not defined by your reactivity or your moments of depletion or your latest behavior. You are a parent who is good inside, and you are working on yourself at the same time as you are giving to your kids.\nBuilding Connection Capital When parents struggle with their kids, it almost always boils down to one of two problems: children don’t feel as connected to their parents as they want to, or children have some struggle or unmet need they feel alone with.\nHaving a healthy amount of connection capital leads kids to feel confident, capable, safe, and worthy. And these positive feelings on the inside lead to “good” behavior on the outside—behavior like cooperation, flexibility, and regulation.\nParents are big connection capital spenders, because we often have to ask kids to do things they don’t want to do and to respect our rules when they’d rather not. This means that parents need to be even bigger connection-builders.\nPNP Time Give it a name to indicate that this time is special. Limit time to ten to fifteen minutes. No phones, no screens, no siblings, no distractions. Let your child pick the play. This is key. Allow your child to be in the spotlight; your job is only to notice, imitate, reflect, and describe what they’re doing.\nFill-Up Game. Offer the idea that your child’s defiant behavior is the result of not being filled up with Mommy (or Daddy), and so it must be time to get a big dose. Add silliness and laughter.\nEmotional vaccination\nWe connect with our kids, discuss and validate the challenge they might soon face, and verbalize or even rehearse how we might handle it—all before it happens.\nVisualize a situation that might be tough for you today. Now, direct inward caring, understanding, and allowing in advance: “I am allowed to feel this way. I am going to take a deep breath now, in anticipation . . . and maybe I’ll find that deep-breath-and-compassion circuit when the moment itself comes.”\nEmotional Vaccination = Connection + Validation + A Story to Understand\nCarried out before the “main event.”\nThe Feeling Bench\n“Hey! You’re feeling [sad/scared/angry/left out]. That’s okay. I’m here. Tell me more,”\nSit down on this bench without making any attempt to pull him off. “This is how I am building connection with him and resilience inside of him.”\nWords:\n“That sounds really hard.” “That stinks. It really does.” “I’m so glad you’re talking to me about this.” “I believe you.” “Being a kid right now . . . ugh, it feels so so hard. I get that.” “You’re really sad about that. You’re allowed to be, sweetie.” “I’m right here with you. I’m so glad we’re together talking about this.” “Sometimes we don’t have a way to feel better right away. Sometimes when things feel tough, the best we can do is talk nicely to ourselves and talk to people who understand.” “I love you. I love you the same no matter how you’re feeling and no matter what is happening in your life.” Sit on the couch or the bed with your child as they talk to you. Say very little as they talk. Nod. Look sympathetic. Offer your child a hug while they’re upset. Breathe deeply together.\nPlayfulness\nSuggestions for playfulness: Silly dance parties. “Talent Show”—everyone Making up songs or rhymes. Family karaoke.\nPlaying dress-up, playing house, or other fantasy play. Building a fort. Use playfulness as a first response to missed manners, not listening, or whining.\n“Did I Ever Tell You About the Time . . . ?”\ninvolves the parent’s relating to the child’s struggle from a personal perspective—builds connection, acknowledges a child’s good-inside-ness, and teaches problem-solving skills, all without talking about the problem directly, which can feel too intense for a kid in the moment.\nIdentify the essence of your child’s struggle.\nTake on the problem as your own:\nTalk to your child not in the heat of the moment but when things are calm, starting with, “Did I ever tell you about the time . . . ?,” and share a story about yourself having a similar struggle. Engage your child in this story, ideally one where you didn’t come up with a quick fix but struggled and just kind of got through it.\nDo not end your story by directly relating it to your child.\nYou’re connecting deeply, because you’re showing your child your vulnerabilities.\nThe gap between a child’s world of struggle and a parent’s world of capability is intimidating for kids, and it can be (unintentionally) shame inducing.\nTwo things can be true: you can be good and you can struggle . . . just like me.”\nChange the Ending\nRepair offers us the opportunity to change the ending to the story.\nDifference between repairing and apologizing. Oftentimes, apologies attempt to shut down a conversation (“I’m sorry I yelled. Okay, can we move on?”), but a good repair opens one up. A repair goes further than an apology, because it looks to reestablish a close connection after a moment when someone feels hurt, misunderstood, or alone.\nScript for Changing the Ending:\nShare that you’ve been reflecting. Acknowledge the other person’s experience. State what you would do differently next time. Connect through curiosity now that things feel safer.\nLove to listen and understand [curiosity].”\nWhen someone reflects with you (“I’ve been thinking about . . .”) and acknowledges your feelings (“You must have been upset to have . . .” or “That must have felt scary when I . . .”), they make it clear they they’re considering your state of mind instead of just your surface-level behavior.\nTake ownership and tell your kids that they aren’t responsible for causing your feelings or fixing your reactions.\nAnd remember: nothing feels as awful to kids as the painful feelings they are left alone with; repair replaces this aloneness with connection, and this should be the ultimate trade-up for all of us.\nNot Listening When we say “My kid doesn’t listen,” we’re not really talking about listening.\nWhat we mean is “My kid won’t cooperate when I want him to do something he doesn’t want to do.”\nThe more connected we feel to someone, the more we want to comply with their requests.\nSo when our kids aren’t listening to us, it’s critical to frame the struggle not as a child problem but as a relationship problem.\nConsider what’s going on for that child, what must feel hard or frustrating, and why my child might be feeling “unseen” or pushed to the side.\nWe ask our kids to do something they “have to do” but don’t want to do—something that is a priority for us but not for them. It’s reasonable to struggle with cooperation in these scenarios.\nYelling, for example, is not an effective way to inspire cooperation. In fact, it’s counterproductive.\nWhen we yell, our kids’ bodies enter into threat mode—they perceive danger from a parent’s aggressive tone, volume, and body language, and they cannot even process what the parent is saying because their energy is focused only on surviving the moment.\nConnect Before You Ask. Give Your Child a Choice.\nHumor\nWhen we infuse playfulness instead of frustration, we join our children in the world they always prefer—one filled with silliness, lightheartedness, and laughter.\nClose Your Eyes Hack\n“I am going to close my eyes”—then place your hands over your eyes—“and all I’m saying is that if there is a child with his shoes on when I open my eyes . . . oh my goodness, if there is a child all Velcroed up . . . I just don’t know what I am going to do! I am going to be so confused! I may even—oh no oh no—have to do a silly jumpy dance and wiggle all around and I may even fall on the floor!” Then pause. Wait.\nRole-Reversal Game\nThe more we help a child, in general, feel seen, independent, trustworthy, and in control, the more willing they will be to listen to our requests.\n“I know being a kid is tough. There are so many things that parents ask of you! So let’s play a game. For the next five minutes, you’re the adult and I’m the kid.\nI have to do what you say, assuming it’s safe.”\nDoes not involve food or gifts.\nWhile you play the game, exaggerate how hard it is to listen to your “parent”; voice things like, “Ughhhhhh, really? I have to clean up the Magna-Tiles? I don’t waaaaaaant to.”\nEmotional Tantrums When children seem to “lose it”—are a sign of one thing and one thing only: that a child cannot manage the emotional demands of a situation.\nTantrums are biological states of dysregulation, not willful acts of disobedience.\nBut we cannot encourage subservience and compliance in our kids when they’re young and expect confidence and assertiveness when they’re older.\nWhen our intention is simply to stop the yelling or crying, kids feel it and learn only one lesson: “The feelings that overwhelm me also overwhelm my parent. My parent is trying to end this, which means my emotions truly are as bad as they feel.”\nStrategies: Remind Yourself of Your Own Goodness\n“Nothing is wrong with me. Nothing is wrong with my child. I can cope with this.”\nTwo Things Are True\n“I get why you feel this way,” or “It feels so bad, I know!” or “Being a kid can be so hard.”\nWe are not in charge of our children’s feelings, our kids don’t need to say “Sure, no problem!” when we make decisions, and communicating that we are okay with our children’s feelings will teach them to be okay with having big feelings, which is critical to developing emotion regulation.\nName the Wish\nSay out loud what your child is wishing for that they aren’t getting.\nValidate the Magnitude\nWhen we validate the intensity of their feelings, we help to reframe a confusing mass of emotion into something concrete and easier to understand.\nYou might say: “You want those crayons . . . You want them SO big . . . as big as this room! Or no . . . as big as this whole house! What? Oh wow. As big as this whole neighborhood!”\nAggresive Tantrums Even these tantrums are normal.\nThese types of tantrums—ones that involve boundary violations (contacting someone else’s body and aggressive behavior)—are a signal that a child’s frontal lobe, the part of the brain responsible for executive functioning, including controlling impulses, is totally offline and that he is physiologically flooded and in a “threat” state.\nThese explosive moments happen because a child is terrified of the sensations, urges, and feelings coursing inside their body.\nKeeping a child safe in this case means focusing on containment, because a child who is out of control needs a parent to step in firmly, put a stop to the dangerous behavior, and create a safer, more boundaried environment where the child cannot continue to do damage.\nDon’t try to teach or lecture or build new skills with your kid in these explosive moments; containment is the only goal.\nStrategies “I Won’t Let You”\nThese four words—“I won’t let you”—are critical for every parent’s toolbox.\nCommunicates that a parent is in charge.\nDifferentiate Urge from Action\nFinding safe ways to redirect our children’s urges can be much more successful than trying to shut down the urges themselves.\nContain the Fire\n“My number one job is to keep you safe, and right now safety means carrying you to your room and sitting with you there.\nYou’re not in trouble. I love you. I’m here.”\nGet into the room, shut the door, sit at the door so your child cannot get out.\nPrevent any physical aggression.\nFocus on your own deep breaths.\nIf they can feel your regulation, even in their state of such major dysregulation, you are helping them calm down.\nDon’t try to reason, don’t lecture, don’t punish, don’t say too much at all.\nLikely to interpret anything you say as additional danger.\nLoud, chaotic tantrums need calm, steady voices.\n“You’re a good kid having a hard time. I’m here. I love you. Do your thing. You’re allowed to feel this way.”\nPersonify the Feelings\nKids can say some nasty things: “I hate you!” or “Leave me alone!” or “I hope you die!”.\nYour child is saying these words aloud and seems to be throwing them in your direction, but consider your child is actually talking to the overwhelming, terrifying, threatening feelings inside his body.\nWhen you reframe kids’ words in this way, you’ll find it much easier to stay present and grounded. You’ll see that your child feels terrified and under attack and clearly needs you there.\nTelling the Story\nBy returning to the scene of the emotional fire and layering on connection, empathy, and understanding, you add key elements of regulation on top of the moment of dysregulation.\nRemember that the key element is the connection and storytelling, not the solution.\nSibling Rivalry When kids are going at it with each other, they’re “telling” their parents that they feel unsettled, that their sibling feels like a threat to their essential need to feel secure in the family.\nThe more we connect with our kids about how they feel—in this case maybe jealous or angry toward a sibling—the less likely they are to explode in the form of behavior: insults, hitting, mockery, put-downs.\nStrategies PNP Time\nDedicated alone time for each child to spend with a parent.\nMaking things fair is one of the biggest propellants of conflict. The more we work for fairness, the more we create opportunities for competition.\nWe want to help our kids orient inward to figure out their needs, not orient outward.\nInstead of making things equal (“You’ll get new shoes soon!”), label what’s happening inside your child: “It’s so hard to see your brother get new shoes. Can you get new ones? Not right now, sweetie. In this family, every kid gets what they need—and your shoes are still in great shape. You’re allowed to be upset. I get it.”\nAllow Venting (but Only to You)\nWhen your children know they can talk to you honestly about their feelings toward their sibling(s), they become much less likely to take out their feelings on their brother or sister.\nName-calling is not innocent teasing; it’s one way a kid can chip away at another kid’s confidence, especially when parents don’t step in to stop it.\nStep In When There’s Danger, Slow Down and Narrate When There’s Not\nWe want to teach our kids to problem-solve with each other, not rely on us to judge who is right and who is wrong, who goes first and who goes second.\nWe must step in to protect both kids: the kid who is being threatened and the kid who is out of control. Both kids need our help.\nStep In (Dangerous Situations)\nSlow Down and Narrate (Not Dangerous “I won’t let you” situations may also include nasty words or taunting or teasing; this is another reason why a parent might step in and separate their kids, to protect one child from bullying and to protect the other from continuing to take on the role of bully. Both kids need our help.\nSlow Down (Not Dangerous Situations)\nSlow things down but not solve.\nHelping each of them narrate their perspective without taking sides or making someone the “bad kid” or the “good kid.”\nSlow down the situation so your kids can regulate their bodies and have access to their own problem-solving skills.\nRudeness and Defiance Strategies Don’t Take the Bait\nDeeper and more vulnerable—seeing the feelings underneath the words.\n*Put a boundary around your child’s behavior (“I won’t allow . . .” or “I won’t let you . . .”).\nProvide a generous interpretation\nEmbody Your Authority—Without Punishing or Being Scary\nTake deep breaths.\nConsider whether there’s a way to sublimate the urge.\nReflect and act later.\nState the Truth\nThe next time you’re setting a rule you know your child won’t like, say as much. When you do this, you establish your connection by validating her experience and you provide an opportunity to brainstorm and cope in advance.\nConnect and Build Regulation When Everyone Is Calm\nKids also whine when they’re looking for connection, to indicate that they feel alone and unseen in their desires.\nChildren are often looking for an emotional release, and whining is a sign that everything feels like too much.\nChannel Your Own Inner Whiner\nStrategies Humor\nRestate the Request in Your Own Voice and Move On\nSee the Need\nWhen kids are whining, they are asking for some combination of more attention, more connection, more warmth, more empathy, and more validation.\nLying Child may be coping with her guilt, or her fear of disappointing or enraging you in that moment, by entering into fantasy.\nKids, of all ages, need to have some part of their lives that is separate from their parents, to access feelings of ownership and sovereignty. For some kids, lying becomes a core strategy to achieve this basic human need.\nStrategies Reframe the Lie as a Wish\n“You wish that tower was still up . . . ,”\nWait and Provide an Opening Later\n“If It Did Happen . . .”\nWhen a child is stuck in a lie, I find it effective to walk through how I would respond if she shared the truth.\nAsking a Child What He Needs to Be Honest\nI realize there must be things you need from me in order to tell me the truth.\nThere must be things I’m doing that make truth-telling scary for you,\nNot to change the feeling itself but to be curious about their children’s anxiety and to help them feel at home with themselves when that anxiety emerges.\nFears and Anxiety Jump into the Hole with Them\n“When you go to bed, you have a big worry that I won’t be there in the morning, huh? Ugh, that is such a scary thought . . .”\n(Pulling out might have sounded like, “Sweetie. There’s nothing to worry about, I have never left without telling you!”)\nDry Runs\nPractice dry runs directly with your child or act out the scenario with stuffed animals.\nScript for Addressing Specific Fears\nSTEP 1: Talk to your child about his fear, aiming only to collect information and build understanding.\nAsk more, and tell less—no convincing or explaining, just information gathering. Then restate what you’ve learned to see if you “have it right.”\nSTEP 2: Validate that your child’s fear “makes sense.”\nSTEP 3: Tell your child how glad you are that you talked about this fear. Use the word “important.”\nSTEP 4: Engage your child to problem-solve with you.\nSTEP 5: Create a mantra.\nSTEP 6: Share a “slowly coping with a fear” story.\nHesitation and Shyness Confidence is the experience of knowing how you feel and believing it’s okay to be yourself, in that feeling, in that moment.\nConfidence-building for hesitant kids comes from having caregivers who say, “I’m here. Take your time.”\nThese messages communicate an understanding that a child knows their feelings better than we do.\nStrategies Check In with Yourself\n“Noticing how I feel doesn’t make me a bad parent. All feelings are allowed, just like I tell my kids. Knowing my own trigger will help me separate my experience from my child’s.”\nIf you notice that your child’s shyness or hesitation or clinginess bothers you, remind yourself that a child’s willingness to not join the crowd is probably a trait you’ll value in her later on.\nValidate + “You’ll Know When You’re Ready”\nValidating the feeling rather than trying to convince him out of the feeling.\n“You’ll know when you’re ready to ___.”\nPreparation\nThere’s so much power in predicting feelings: when you name and recognize them in advance, it’s as if you give your child permission to feel them, which is half the battle when it comes to regulation.\nKids who feel hesitant do well with preparation for what’s to come, in terms of both logistics and emotions. Before you go to, say, a family gathering, share details with your child.\nAvoid Labeling\nWhen we label kids, saying things like “Oh, she’s shy” or “He never likes to talk to grown-ups, he’s really reserved,” we lock them into roles with a type of rigidity that makes growth difficult.\nInstead of labeling, provide a generous interpretation of your child’s behavior, especially if someone else smacks on a label. If a family member says, “Aisha, why are you being so shy?,” take a breath, jump in, and share, “Aisha isn’t shy. Aisha is figuring out what feels comfortable to her, and that’s great.\nFrustration Intolerance The more we embrace not-knowing and mistakes and struggles, the more we set the stage for growth, success, and achievement.\nIf we want our kids to develop frustration tolerance, we have to develop tolerance for their frustration.\nShow up in a calm, regulated, non-rushed, non-blaming, non-outcome-focused way—both when they are performing difficult tasks and when they are witnessing us perform difficult tasks.\nRequires us to let go of our need to finish and be quick and be right and have things done.\nFrustration tolerance requires us to ground ourselves in what is happening in the moment, to feel okay even when we don’t know how to do something, and to focus on effort instead of outcome.\nThis is a lot easier to do when we navigate the world with a “growth mindset”—the belief that abilities can be cultivated through effort, study, and persistence and that failures and struggles are not enemies of learning but rather key elements on the pathway to learning.\nPeople with a “fixed mindset,” on the other hand, believe that abilities are innate—you can either do something or you can’t, and if you fail at that thing, it’s an indication that you’ll never be able to do it.\nMy job as a parent is not to help my kids get out of the learning space and into knowing . . . but rather to help my kids learn to stay in that learning space and tolerate not being in knowing!\nStrategies Deep Breaths\nWhen you notice your child getting frustrated, instead of telling them, “Take a deep breath,” model it yourself.\nOur kids learn to self-regulate through our co-regulation; taking a deep breath allows your child to see that there can be safety and calm around frustration.\nNot to mention, our deep breathing grounds us, which means we are less likely to react with our own annoyance or reactivity.\nMantras\nTake moments or emotions that feel big and overwhelming—like episodes of frustration—and give us something small and manageable to focus on.\n‘This feels hard because it is hard, not because I’m doing something wrong.’\nTry framing it as something you learned that you just happen to be passing along.\nFor younger kids, a mantra might be “I can do it” or “I like to be challenged” or “I can do hard things” or “This is tricky and I can stay with it.”\nFrame Frustration as a Sign of Learning, Not a Sign of Failure\nHere’s something I start saying to my kids early on: “Did you know that learning is hard? I mean it! Every single time any of us learns something—me, you, everyone—it feels frustrating!”\n“And also, listen to this, because this is weird . . . Frustration, that feeling of ‘Ugh, I can’t do it’ or ‘Ugh, I want to just be done already!’ . . . that’s a feeling that tries to trick our brain into telling us we’re doing something wrong, but actually, this feeling is a sign that we’re learning and doing something right! It’s such a tricky thing. Let’s be on the lookout for that feeling so we can remind ourselves we are learning and that learning is supposed to feel this way.”\n“Oh, you’re about to get dressed, huh? Let’s get ready for that frustrating feeling.\nGrowth Mindset Family Values\nIn our family, we love to be challenged.\nIn our family, how hard we work is more important than coming up with the right answer.\nIn our family, we know that not-knowing sits next to learning something new. We love learning new things, so we embrace “I don’t know” moments.\nIn our family, we try to remember that sticking with something hard makes our brains grow. And we’re big into brain growth.\nThink in Terms of Coping, Not Success\nBuild our child’s skills for coping with hard feelings rather than building skills for finding success.\nEmotional Vaccination, Dry Runs, and “Did I Ever Tell You About the Time . . . ?”\nFood and Eating Habits “Division of Responsibility” around eating.\nParent’s job: decide what food is offered, where it is offered, when it is offered Child’s job: decide whether and how much to eat of what’s offered.\nMinimizing anxiety around food is more important than consumption of food.\nStrategies Mantra\nYou might try saying, “My only jobs are the what-when-where. I can do that. I can do that.” Or, “What my child eats is not most important. I am doing a good job. My child is going to be okay.” Or maybe, “What my child eats is not a barometer of my parenting.”\nExplain Roles\nDessert-Specific Strategies\nParents shouldn’t link dessert to how much a child eats, because that is the domain of a child, not a parent.\nServing dessert with dinner makes dessert less exciting. It exudes a message of trusting your child and sets him up to be less dessert focused over time.\nOther families I’ve worked with serve a “dessert” as an afternoon snack so that dinner isn’t linked with dessert at all.\nSnack-Specific Strategies\nTolerate Pushback\nIf you want to make a change, it’s critical to remind yourself that your job is the “what, when, where”—you don’t have to ask your kids’ permission, you just need to announce the change and allow them to have their reactions and feelings.\nAfter knowing our role, we have to be willing to fulfill it, and that relies on our ability to handle our child’s not being happy with us.\nConsent “I am in charge of my body. I am in charge of my body boundaries. I am in charge of who touches me, for how long, and at what times.\nI can like something one day and not want it another day. I can be comfortable touching some people and not others. I am the only person who can make these decisions.”\n“There will be times when I assert myself based on what feels right to me and other people won’t like it. They will push back. They will talk about what they want from me instead of honoring what I’m telling them feels comfortable to me. It’s not my job to make other people happy. Their discomfort is a feeling in their body, and it’s not my fault or my responsibility to make this feeling go away.”\nStrike the following words from their parenting:\nVocabulary (feel free to strike them from all interactions outside of parenting as well!): “dramatic,” “drama queen,” “overly sensitive,” “hysterical,” “disproportionate,” “ridiculous.” These are gaslighting words that tell a child you don’t trust them—which wires them not to trust themself.\nStrategies “I Believe You”\n“There’s Something About . . .”\nUse the phrase “There’s something about . . .” It says you believe your child and you validated their experience, even if you don’t understand what exactly is happening.\n“You’re the only one in your body, so only you could know what you like.”\nSocratic Questioning\nkids learn best when they are encouraged to think and consider, which comes from asking questions.\nThe next time you have an “opening” with your child—a nice quiet moment when you’re getting along—explore the topics of decision-making, asserting one’s wants and needs, and tolerating other people’s distress.\nWhat’s more important, doing something that feels right to you or making other people happy? What if you can’t do both? When does making someone else happy, instead of doing something that feels right, feel okay to you? When would it be extra-important to choose doing what feels right, even if someone else is super unhappy? What if you do something that you want and someone else gets mad at you . . . does this mean you’re a bad person? Why or why not?” Start with, “Oooooh, I have an interesting question . . . ,”\nTears If I want to have the seriousness of my feelings recognized or my needs known, and I sense that someone is responding to me with disinterest, invalidation, or minimization, then my body would undoubtedly escalate into a more intense expression.\nWhen we look at fake tears through this lens, we think less about the on-the-surface expression and more about the underlying unmet needs.\nWords like “I can tell something important is happening for you. I care about that. I’m here,” or “I can see how upset you are. I believe you. I really do,” are powerful scripts for your toolbox in these moments.\nStrategies Talk About Tears\nTalk about crying with your child outside of the moment your child is crying.\nHere, we are de-shaming the crying experience; after all, when you explicitly share with your child that you have cried, even over seemingly “small” things, your child feels less alone with their tears.\nConnect Tears with Importance\n“Tears tell us something important is happening in our body.”\nDo you know that sometimes our body knows things before our brain does? My body must have been thinking of something important.\nSocratic Questioning\nTake some time to wonder aloud with your kids about tears, encouraging them to think deeply and question the common narrative that tears are a sign of weakness.\nWhat do you think tears tell us? Are tears good, or bad, or neither good nor bad—maybe they just are? Did you know that tears release stress from our bodies? Isn’t that interesting? There are some people who don’t like to cry. I wonder why? Can boys and girls cry? Can adults and kids cry? Can men and women cry? Is it more okay for girls or boys to cry or okay for both? Why? How did you learn that?” Building Confidence Confidence is not about feeling “good,” it’s about believing, “I really know what I feel right now.”\nConfidence is our ability to feel at home with ourselves in the widest range of feelings possible, and it’s built from the belief that it’s okay to be who you are no matter what you’re feeling.\n“Good job, honey!” and “You’re so smart!” and “You’re an amazing artist!”—these well-intentioned phrases build up a child’s reliance on external validation, or approval from other people.\nInternal validation, on the other hand—which is what we want to encourage in our kids—is the process of seeking approval from oneself.\nWe all seek external validation, and we all like external validation. This is okay. The goal isn’t to make a child impervious to other people’s approval or input, but rather to build up a child’s interiority—meaning who they are on the inside—so that they don’t feel empty and confused in the absence of outside input.\nCommenting on what’s happening inside a child, or a child’s process and not product, orients a child to gaze back in instead of out.\n“You’re working so hard on that project,” “I notice you’re using different colors in this drawing, tell me about this,” “How’d you think to make that?” Lead with Validation\nWhen we name feelings and validate them, we show a child that those feelings are okay.\nHow’d You Think to . . . ?\n“How’d you think to draw that?” “How’d you think to start your story that way?” “How’d you think to solve that math problem?” “How’d you think to use those materials together?” When we wonder with our kids about the “how” instead of praising the “what,” we help build up their tendency to gaze in and be curious about themselves, and maybe even to marvel at the things they’ve done.\nNothing feels better than when someone around us expresses interest in how we think about things, how we came up with our ideas, or where we want to go next.\nInside Stuff over Outside Stuff\nCircuitry for self-confidence depends on a child’s ability to locate identity over observable behavior; this comes from growing up in a family that focuses more on what’s “inside” a child (enduring qualities, feelings, ideas) than what is “outside” (accomplishments, outcomes, labels).\nValuing who they are over what they do.\n“You Really Know How You’re Feeling”/“It’s Okay to Feel This Way”\nPhrases like “You really know how you’re feeling right now,” or “Wow, you really know yourself”—these responses teach a child to look inward with openness, not judgment.\nPerfectionism To help kids with perfectionistic tendencies, then, we want to show them how to separate what they are doing from who they are.\nParents should aim to help their kids see their perfectionism, not get rid of it.\nStrategies Make Your Own Mistakes\n“Oh no! I sent an important email to my boss with so many typos!\n“I am okay even when I make a mistake. I am safe. I am good inside even when I make a mistake on the outside.”\nTell the Story of the Feeling Under the Perfectionism\nTake your child’s focus on perfection and shift it to the feelings inside his body; this builds self-awareness of one’s experience, which is the foundation for regulation.\n“Sometimes one tricky thing feels like it can suck all the fun out of something, huh? It’s almost like nothing at the playground feels like it would be fun if you don’t feel good at every single part.”\nStuffed Animal Play\nUsing stuffed animals or trucks or whatever your child likes to play with, act out a scene involving a perfectionistic character.\nIntroduce the Perfect Voice\nIn a calm moment, introduce the idea of you and your child both having a “Perfect Kid” or “Perfect Girl” or “Perfect Boy” inside.\nIdentifying the different “parts” of us speaks to how our mind is organized, and kids often take to this framework because it resonates with what actually goes on inside their bodies.\nTeaching your child how to relate to her perfectionism rather than reject it.\n“Do you know that I have a Perfect Girl in me? Yes! She often tells me things have to be perfect or else they’re not worth doing!\nDo a 180 on Perfectionism\n“Not knowing something means I can learn, and learning new things is awesome. I learned one thing just now so I get one point!”\nThis game, “winning” isn’t equated with being “perfect” or already knowing something, but instead with the process of learning.\nSeparation Anxiety Transitional objects help children with this process; a blanket or stuffed animal or object from home becomes a physical representation of parent-child bond, reminding a child that parents still exist and are “there” for you even when they are not right in front of them.\nA vital part of separation is a parent’s ability to believe that their kids can cope.\nIf our kids sense that we are hesitant or nervous or doubtful, their separation reactions will be more intense, because they will absorb our anxiety.\nStrategies Check In with Your Own Anxiety\nTalk About Separation and Feelings\nTalk about the separation in advance—show pictures of where your child is going, and anticipate feelings that may come up.\nRoutine + Practice\nCome up with a routine that is easy to practice and repeat—something short and sweet. Maybe you say, “When we say goodbye, I’ll give you one hug, say ‘See ya later, alligator!’\nPractice will make the whole routine feel more familiar, and eventually lead to mastery, which helps separation feel safer.\nTransitional Object\nConsider involving your child in a transitional object choice. (Object that reminds them of you.)\nTelling the Story\nWe can ease separation anxiety by talking about the separation after we pick up our child at the end of the day or at the moment of reunion.\nTelling the story reminds a child that the moment of separation was part of a larger story, but it didn’t color their entire experience.\nSleep Sleep struggles are ultimately separation struggles, because during the night children are tasked with being alone for ten(ish) hours and also with feeling safe enough that their body is able to drift off to sleep.\nNighttime can feel truly dangerous to kids—it means darkness, aloneness, the slowing down of the body and the speeding up of the mind, the emergence of scary thoughts, and even existential worries about permanence (“Are my parents really there when I can’t see them?”).\ntwo-step process:\nFirst, we have to help our kids feel safe. We have to help them develop coping skills during the day, when the stakes are lower, before a child will feel safe enough to separate at night.\nThen, and only then, can we implement strategies to create a smoother bedtime experience.\nKids who struggle to separate have trouble internalizing the soothing aspects of a parent-child relationship—they feel safe in a parent’s presence but, often, terrified in a parent’s absence.\nSeparation starts to feel more manageable when we close this gap, when we help a child take in the parts of the parent-child relationship that provide security so that they can access feelings of safety, security, and trust, all of which are necessary for sleep.\nIf we can help infuse a parent’s presence into a child’s environment, then he can access the soothing function of the parent-child relationship even when the parent isn’t right there.\nStrategies “Where Is Everyone?”\nTo help your kids understand, talk to them, during the daytime, about where you spend your evening.\nExamine Your Daytime Separation Routine\nBefore tackling nighttime separation struggles (i.e., sleep struggles!), work on these dynamics during the day; nighttime can be filled with extra anxiety, so we need to build separation skills when our bodies are less activated and more receptive to learning.\nRole-Play\nGet out the stuffed animals, trucks, dolls, or whatever your child likes to play with. Use them to act out a bedtime routine, reviewing feelings that come up and strategies that help with the soothing process.\nInfuse Your Presence\nThink of various ways to infuse your presence into your child’s room and bed area. Maybe you put a family photo next to your child’s sleep area and a photo of your child next to your bed as well.\nTell your child you’ll write them a note or create a drawing with their name on it after they fall asleep and put it next to their bed;\nMantras for You and Your Child\n‘Mommy is near, Nahid is safe, my bed is cozy.’\nThe Safe Distance Method\nThis method operates on the principles of attachment theory, respecting that children need to feel proximal to parents in order to feel safe. Start out in a child’s room, staying close by, then—over the course of many nights—increase the distance until you are farther and farther away (and eventually out of the room).\nThe Comfort Button\nGet a recordable button with at least thirty seconds of recordable space. Then, in your regulated, soothing voice, record a message for your child about bedtime.\nDeeply Feeling Kids I use the label “Deeply Feeling Kids” (DFKs)—it reflects the way they experience the world and it also explains why these children often feel overwhelmed and enter more easily into a “threat” or “fight or flight” state.\nOne of the core fears for DFKs is that the feelings that overwhelm them will overwhelm others—that things that feel so bad and unmanageable actually are bad and unmanageable.\nParents of DFKs have to practice “holding space”—meaning literally staying present around the child and taking up space, so that the child sees her overwhelming feelings aren’t taking over the world around her and leaving her all alone.\nParents of DFKs have to commit to limiting the damage instead of solving the problem.\nStrategies Move from Blame to Curiosity\nCuriosity, on the other hand, sounds like: “I wonder what’s going on for my child?” or “My child feels inside the way they’re acting on the outside . . . wow, my child feels so out of control and so ‘bad’! What’s going on there? What does she need?”\nContainment First\nTake a deep breath and remember that their number one job is to keep their child safe. In times like these, that means removing the child from the current situation, bringing him to a smaller room, sitting with him, and being present for the emotional storm.\n“You’re a Good Kid Having a Hard Time”\nReminding ourselves that we have a good kid having a hard time activates our desire to help, while “bad kid doing bad things” mode makes us want to judge or punish.\nYou might say, “Earlier today was tough. I know. You’re a good kid and you were having a hard time. I know that. I love you. I always will.”\nBe Present and Wait It Out\nNothing is as powerful as your presence. Your loving, as-calm-as-possible presence, without any words or fancy scripts.\nWithout a doubt your most important parenting “tool.”\nWe have to show our kids that they aren’t “too much” for us, that they don’t overpower us.\nPresence doesn’t mean we allow ourselves to be hit or put into danger. And it doesn’t mean you can’t take time-outs for yourself.\nThumbs Up/Down/to the Side\nI’m going to say some things . . . if you agree, give me a thumbs-up. If it’s a no, give me a thumbs-down. If something about what I say is kind of right, kind of not, give me a thumbs-to-the-side.”\nThe key to change lies in learning to tolerate the guilt or shame that comes up for us—seeing these feelings as part of the change process, not an enemy of the change process.\nTwo things are true I have done things I am not proud of and I am good inside.\nI feel guilty about my parenting past and hopeful about my parenting future.\nBooks and Authors mentioned: Book: Psychologists Robert Brooks and Sam Goldstein, authors of The Handbook of Resilience in Children\nBook: Beyond Discipline: From Compliance to Community, author Alfie Kohn\nBook: Siblings Without Rivalry\nAuthor: Ellyn Satter",

Hugo is a static site generator than takes markdown files and converts them to html.\nHosting your own website is also a lot cheaper than having a provider like Bluehost do it for you. Instead of $15 per month, I am currently paying $10 per year.\nThis guide will walk through building a website step-by-step.\nSetting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) Registering a domain name Pointing the domain to your server Setting up hugo on your local PC Syncing your Hugo generate site with your server Using nginx to serve your site Enable http over SSL Setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) I use Vultr as my VPS. When I signed up they had a $250 credit towards a new account. If you select the cheapest server (you shouldn’t need anything else for a basic site) that comes out to about $6 a month. Of course the $250 credit goes towards that which equates to around 41 months free.\nHead to vultr.com. Create and account and Select the Cloud Compute option.\nUnder CPU \u0026 Storage Technology, select “Regular Performance”. Then under “Server Location, select the server closest to you. Or closest to where you think your main audience will be.\nUnder Server image, select the OS you are most comfortable with. This guide uses Debian.\nUnder Server Size, slect the 10GB SSD. Do not select the “IPv6 ONLY” option. Leave the other options as default and enter your server hostname.\nOn the products page, click your new server. You can find your server credentials and IPv4 address here. You will need these to log in to your server.\nLog into your sever via ssh to test. From a Linux terminal run:\nssh username@serveripaddress Then, enter your password when prompted.\nRegistering a Domain Name I got my domain perfectdarkmode.com from Cloudflare.com for about $10 per year. You can check to see available domains there. You can also check https://www.namecheckr.com/ to see iof that name is available on various social media sites.\nIn CloudFlare, just click “add a site” and pick a domain that works for you. Next, you will need your server address from earlier.\nUnder domain Registration, click “Manage Domains”, click “manage” on your domain. One the sidebar to the right, there is a qucik actions menu. Click “update DNS configuration”.\nClick “Add record”. Type is an “A” record. Enter the name and the ip address that you used earlier for your server. Uncheck “Proxy Status” and save.\nYou can check to see if your DNS has updated on various DNS severs at https://dnschecker.org/. Once those are up to date (after a couple minutes) you should be able to ping your new domain.\n$ ping perfectdarkmode.com PING perfectdarkmode.com (104.238.140.131) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=1 ttl=53 time=33.2 ms 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=2 ttl=53 time=28.2 ms 64 bytes from 104.238.140.131.vultrusercontent.com (104.238.140.131): icmp_seq=3 ttl=53 time=31.0 ms Now, you can use the same ssh command to ssh into your vultr serverusing your domain name.\nssh username@domain.com Setting up hugo on your local PC Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator. It allows you to take markdown files, and builds them into and html website. To start go to https://gohugo.io/installation/ and download Hugo on your local computer. (I will show you how to upload the site to your server later.)\nPick a theme The theme I use is here https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng/\nYou can browse your own themes as well. Just make sure to follow the installation instructions. Let’s create a new Hugo site. Change into the directory where you want your site to be located in. Mine rests in ~/Documents/.\ncd ~/Documents/ Create your new Hugo site.\nhugo new site site-name This will make a new folder with your site name in the ~/Documents directory. This folder will have a few directories and a config file in it.\narchetypes config.toml content data layouts public resources static themes For this tutorial, we will be working with the config.toml file and the content, public, static, and themes. Next, load the theme into your site directory. For the Hello Friend NG theme:\ngit clone https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng.git themes/hello-friend-ng Now we will load the example site into our working site. Say yes to overwrite.\ncp -a themes/hello-friend-ng/exampleSite/* . The top of your new config.toml site now contains:\nbaseURL = \"https://example.com\" title = \"Hello Friend NG\" languageCode = \"en-us\" theme = \"hello-friend-ng\" Replace your baseURL with your site name and give your site a title. Set the enableGlobalLanguageMenu option to false if you want to remove the language swithcer option at the top. I also set enableThemeToggle to true so users could set the theme to dark or light.\nYou can also fill in the links to your social handles. Comment out any lines you don’t want with a “#” like so:\n[params.social](params.social) name = \"twitter\" url = \"https://twitter.com/\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"email\" url = \"mailto:nobody@example.com\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"github\" url = \"https://github.com/\" [params.social](params.social) name = \"linkedin\" url = \"https://www.linkedin.com/\" # [params.social](params.social) # name = \"stackoverflow\" # url = \"https://www.stackoverflow.com/\" You may also want to edit the footer text to your liking.

Also, delete all of the other files here:\ncd ~/Documents/hugo/contents/posts mv goisforlovers.md newpostnamehere.md find . ! -name 'newpostnamehere.md' -type f -exec rm -f {} + Open the new post file and delete everything after this:\n+++ title = \"Building a Minimalist Website with Hugo\" description = \"\" type = [\"posts\",\"post\"] tags = [ \"hugo\", \"nginx\", \"ssl\", \"http\", \"vultr\", ] date = \"2023-03-26\" categories = [ \"tools\", \"linux\", ] series = [\"tools\"] [ author ] name = \"David Thomas\" +++ You will need to fill out this header information for each new post you make. This will allow you to give your site a title, tags, date, categories, etc. This is what is called a TOML header. TOML stands for Tom’s Obvious Minimal Language. Which is a minimal language used for parsing data. Hugo uses TOML to fill out your site.\nSave your doc and exit. Next, there should be an about.md page now in your ~/Documents/hugo/Contents folder. Edit this to edit your about page for your site. You can use this Markdown Guide if you need help learning markdown language. https://www.markdownguide.org/\nServe your website locally Let’s test the website by serving it locally and accessing it at localhost:1313 in your web browser. Enter the command:\nhugo serve Hugo will now be generating your website. You can view it by entering localhost:1313 in your webbrowser.\nYou can use this to test new changes before uploading them to your server. When you svae a post or page file such as your about page, hugo will automatically update the changes to this local page if the local server is running.\nPress “Ctrl + c” to stop this local server. This is only for testing and does not need to be running to make your site work.\nBuild out your public directory Okay, your website is working locally, how do we get it to your server to host it online? We are almost there. First, we will use the hugo command to build your website in the public folder. Then, we will make a copy of our public folder on our server using rsync. I will also show you how to create an alias so you do not have to remember the rsync command every time.\nFrom your hugo site folder run:\nhugo Next, we will put your public hugo folder into /var/www/ on your server. Here is how to do that with an alias. Open ~/.bashrc.\nvim ~/.bashrc Add the following line to the end of the file, making sure to replace the username and server name:\n# My custom aliases alias rsyncp='rsync -rtvzP ~/Documents/hugo/public/ username@myserver.com:/var/www/public' Save and exit the file. Then tell bash to update it’s source config file.\nsource ~/.bashrc Now your can run the command by just using the new alias any time. Your will need to do this every time you update your site locally.\nrsyncp Set up nginx on your server Install nginx\napt update apt upgrade apt install nginx create an nginx config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/\nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/public You will need to add the following to the file, update the options, then save and exit:\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]:80 ; server_name example.org ; root /var/www/mysite ; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html ; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404 ; } } Enter your domain in “server_name” line in place of “example.org”. Also, point “root” to your new site file from earlier. (/var/www/public). Then save and exit.\nLink this site-available config file to sites-enabled to enable it. Then restart nginx:\nln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/public /etc/nginx/sites-enabled systemctl reload nginx Access Permissions We will need to make sure nginx has permissions to your site folder so that it can access them to serve your site. Run:\nchmod 777 /var/www/public Firewall Permissions You will need to make sure your firewall allows port 80 and 443. Vultr installs the ufw program by default. But your can install it if you used a different provider. Beware, enabling a firewalll could block you from accessing your vm, so do your research before tinkering outside of these instructions.\nufw allow 80 ufw allow 443 Nginx Security We will want to hide your nginx version number on error pages. This will make your site a bit harder for hackers to find exploits. Open your Nginx config file at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf and remove the “#” before “server_tokens off;”\nEnter your domain into your browser. Congrats! You now have a running website!\nUse Certbot to enable HTTPS Right now, our site uses the unencrypted http. We want it to use the encrypted version HTTPS (HTTP over SSL). This will increase user privacy, hide usernames and passwords used on your site, and you get the lock symbol by your URL name instead of “!not secure”.\nInstall Certbot and It’s Nginx Module apt install python3-certbot-nginx Run certbot certbot --nginx Fill out the information, certbot asks for your emaill so it can send you a reminder when the certs need to be renewed every 3 months. You do not need to consent to giving your email to the EFF. Press 1 to select your domain. And 2 too redirect all connections to HTTPS.\nCertbot will build out some information in your site’s config file. Refresh your site. You should see your new fancy lock icon.\nSet Up a Cronjob to automatically Renew certbot certs crontab -e Select a text editor and add this line to the end of the file. Then save and exit the file:\n0 0 1 * * certbot --nginx renew You now have a running website. Just make new posts locally, the run “hugo” to rebuild the site. And use the rsync alias to update the folder on your server. I will soon be making tutorials on making an email address for your domain, such as david@perfectdarkmode.com on my site. I will also be adding a comments section, RSS feed, email subscription, sidebar, and more.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions if you get stuck. This is meant to be an all encompassing guide. So I want it to work.\nExtras Optimizing images Create assets folder in main directory.\nCreate images folder in /assets\nAccess image using hugo pipes\n{{ $image := resources.Get \"images/test-image.jpg\" }} \u003cimg src=\"{{ ( $image.Resize \"500x\" ).RelPermalink }}\" /\u003e https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/",

    "content": "It took me a whopping 2 years to finish my CCNA! I kept giving up and quitting my studies for months at a time. Why? Because I couldn’t remember the massive amount of content covered in the CCNA. It felt hopeless. I could have done it in 6 month (or faster) if I knew how to study.\nI hadn’t taken a test in 10 years before this. So I had completely forgotten how to learn. This post is about the mistakes I made studying for the CCNA and how to avoid them.\nYou will also learn, as I did, about spaced repetition. I’ve also included a 6 month CCNA spaced repetition calendar.\nMy Mistakes, So You Don’t Make Them Mistake #1 Didn’t start flashcards until the final 30 days I wish I would have started flashcards from day 1. This would have helped a crap ton. Remembering all of the little details is not only useful for taking the test. It embeds the concepts in your brain and keeps you processing how things work .\nIf there is anything you take from this list. You should definitely be doing some flashcards every day.\nMistake #2 Not enough labs as I went. While studying the OCG and video courses. I did some labs. But I also skipped a ton of labs because it wasn’t convenient at the time. Then I was forced to lab every single topic in the final 30 days. A lot of cramming was done..\nMake sure to do all of the labs as you go. Make up your own labs as well. This is very important to building job worthy skills.\nMistake #3 Didn’t have a plan or stick with it. When your plan consists of, “just read everything and watch the videos and take the test when you feel ready”, you tend to procrastinate and put things off. Make a study schedule and a solid plan. (See below)\nHaving a set date for when you will take the test was pretty motivating. I did not find this out until about 30 days until my test.\nSpaced Repetition If you are using Anki flashcards for your studies, you may already be using spaced repetition. Spaced repetition is repeatedly reviewing with the time in between reviews getting longer each time you review it.\nHere is an excellent article about our learning curves and why spaced repetition helps us remember things https://fs.blog/spacing-effect/\nHow to set up a spaced repetition calendar for CCNA. Step 1. Plan how long your studies will take\nFigure out how long you need. It usually takes around 240 hours of studying for CCNA. (Depending on experience). Then figure out how many hours per day that you can spend on studying. This example is based on a 6 month study calendar.\nYou can use this 6 month excel calendar to plan and track your progress. You. can still use this method If you have already been studying CCNA. Just edit your calendar for how much time you have left.\nThe calendar is also based on Wendel Odom’s Official Cert Guide. You will also want to mix your other resources into your reviews.\nDecide what your review sessions will be\nPlan to review each chapter 3-4 times. here is what I did for review sessions to pass the exam.\nReview 1 Read and highlight (and flashcards)\nRead the chapter. Highlight key information that you want to remember. Do a lab for the material you studied (if applicable) Answer DIKTA questions Start Chapter 1 Anki Flascards Review 2 Copy highlights over to OneNote (keep doing flashcards)\nCopy your highlights over to OneNote. (using copy and paste if you have the digital book) Read your highlights and make sure you understand everything. lab and continue doing flashcards. (just go through Anki suggested flashcards, not just ones for the specific chapter.) Review 3 Labs and Highlight your notes (and flashcards)\nMore labs! Go over your notes. Color coding everything. (You can find my jumbled note mess here) Green: Read again Teal: Very important Learn this/ lab it. Red/ purple: make extra flashcards out of this. Review 4 Practice questions and review\nGo through and answer the DIKTA questions again. Review any missed answers. Lab anything you aren’t quite sure of. The final 30 days I HIGHLY recommend Boson ExSim for your final 30 days of studying. ExSim comes with 3 exams (A,B, and C). Start with exam A in test simulation mode. Leave about a week in between each practice exam so you can go over your answers and Boson’s explanations for each answer.\nOne week before your test, (after you’ve completed exams A,B, and C). Do a random exam. Make sure you do the timed version that don’t show your score as you go.\nYou should be scoring above 900 by your 3rd and 4th exam if you have been reviewing Boson’s answer explanations.\nSchedule your exam\nPearson view didn’t let me schedule the exam past 30 days out from when I wanted to take it. I’m not sure if this is the case all the time. But by the time you are 30 days out you should have your test scheduled. This will light the fire under you. Great motivation for the home stretch.\nIf your exam is around June during Cisco Live, Cisco usually offers a 50% discount for an exam voucher. You probably won’t find any other discounts unless you pay for Cisco’s specific CCNA training.\nFinal word on labs You can technically pass the CCNA without doing many labs. But this will leave you at a HUGE disadvantage in the job market. Labs are crucial for really understanding networking. Knowing your way around the CLI and being able to troubleshoot networking issues will make you stand out from those who crammed for the exam.\nIf you’ve made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to read this post. I really hope it helps at least one person.",

    "content": "I enjoyed reading this more than I thought I would. The emperor spent a great deal thinking about what it means to be human, philosophy, on life, on dying, and how best to navigate the world. Both the internal world of the mind and soul, and the external world of matter and other people.\nThis book makes me want to keep a better journaling habit. And study philosophy. And not worry about things that do not matter. Because we all become dust in the end anyway.\nMarcus Aurellius also cut through what does matter. Such as service to others. Speaking truthfully. Not letting your situation bother you.\nSummary and Highlights Self-control and resistance to distractions.\nOptimism in adversity—especially illness.\nThat I had someone—as a ruler and as a father—who could keep me from being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live without a troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture—the whole charade. That you can behave almost like an ordinary person without seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out official obligations.\nRemember how long you’ve been putting this off, how many extensions the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them. At some point you have to recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time assigned you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone and will never return.\nDo external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all directions. But make sure you guard against the other kind of confusion. People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time—even when hard at work.\nNot just that every day more of our life is used up and less and less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure our mind will still be up to understanding the world—to the contemplation that aims at divine and human knowledge? If our mind starts to wander, we’ll still go on breathing, go on eating, imagining things, feeling urges and so on. But getting the most out of ourselves, calculating where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and see, deciding whether it’s time to call it quits—all the things you need a healthy mind for … all those are gone.\nSo we need to hurry.\nNot just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get there.\nYou need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking.\nWhat is it—this thing that now forces itself on my notice? What is it made up of? How long was it designed to last? And what qualities do I need to bring to bear on it—tranquillity, courage, honesty, trustworthiness, straightforwardness, independence or what?\nPeople try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like.\nBy going within.\nNowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.\nSo keep getting away from it all—like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all and send you back ready to face what awaits you.\nWhat’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration:\nthat rational beings exist for one another; that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience; that no one does the wrong thing deliberately; and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried. “If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.\nBecause most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?”\nBut we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.\nWords once in common use now sound archaic. And the names of the famous dead as well: Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus … Scipio and Cato … Augustus … Hadrian and Antoninus, and …\nEverything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion covers it.\nAnd those are the ones who shone. The rest—“unknown, unasked-for” a minute after death. What is “eternal” fame? Emptiness.\nThen what should we work for?\nOnly this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring.\nConstant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the ones that make plants or children? Go deeper.\nOn the verge of dying and still weighed down, still turbulent, still convinced external things can harm you, still rude to other people, still not acknowledging the truth: that wisdom is justice.\nSo remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.\nA trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of the list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they gain by dying old? In the end, they all sleep six feet under— Caedicianus, Fabius, Julian, Lepidus, and all the rest. They buried their contemporaries, and were buried in turn.\nOur lifetime is so brief. And to live it out in these circumstances, among these people, in this body? Nothing to get excited about. Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of life or three generations: what’s the difference?\nNo one could ever accuse you of being quick-witted.\nAll right, but there are plenty of other things you can’t claim you “haven’t got in you.” Practice the virtues you can show: honesty, gravity, endurance, austerity, resignation, abstinence, patience, sincerity, moderation, seriousness, high-mindedness. Don’t you see how much you have to offer—beyond excuses like “can’t”? And yet you still settle for less.\nOr is it some inborn condition that makes you whiny and grasping and obsequious, makes you complain about your body and curry favor and show off and leaves you so turbulent inside?\nNo. You could have broken free a long way back. And then you would have been only a little slow. “Not so quick on the uptake.”\nAnd you need to work on that as well—that slowness. Not something to be ignored, let alone to prize.\nNot to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.\nThings have no hold on the soul. They have no access to it, cannot move or direct it. It is moved and directed by itself alone. It takes the things before it and interprets them as it sees fit.\nIn a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them.\nKeep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see.\nSo it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.\nSoon you’ll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most—and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other. Quarreling children—laughing and then bursting into tears a moment later. Trust, shame, justice, truth—“ gone from the earth and only found in heaven.”\nWhy are you still here? Sensory objects are shifting and unstable; our senses dim and easily deceived; the soul itself a decoction of the blood; fame in a world like this is worthless.\n—And so?\nWait for it patiently—annihilation or metamorphosis.\n—And until that time comes—what?\nHonor and revere the gods, treat human beings as they deserve, be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh and blood—and nothing else is under your control.\nYou can lead an untroubled life provided you can grow, can think and act systematically.\nTwo characteristics shared by gods and men (and every rational creature):\ni. Not to let others hold you back.\nii. To locate goodness in thinking and doing the right thing, and to limit your desires to that.\nNot to be overwhelmed by what you imagine, but just do what you can and should. And if \u003c…\u003e suffer in inessentials, not to treat that as a defeat. (Bad habit.)\nLike the old man asking for the orphan’s toy on the way out—even though he knew that’s all it was. Like that\nI was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me.\nBut true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune: good character, good intentions, and good actions.\nTo move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind.\nOnly there, delight and stillness.\nWhen jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.\nLike seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love—something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid.\nPerceptions like that—latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That’s what we need to do all the time—all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust—to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.\nPride is a master of deception: when you think you’re occupied in the weightiest business, that’s when he has you in his spell.\n(Compare Crates on Xenocrates.)\nSome things are rushing into existence, others out of it. Some of what now exists is already gone. Change and flux constantly remake the world, just as the incessant progression of time remakes eternity.\nWe find ourselves in a river. Which of the things around us should we value when none of them can offer a firm foothold?\nLike an attachment to a sparrow: we glimpse it and it’s gone.\nAnd life itself: like the decoction of blood, the drawing in of air. We expel the power of breathing we drew in at birth (just yesterday or the day before), breathing it out like the air we exhale at each moment.\nThe way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity—people they’ve never met and never will—that’s what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset at not being a hero to your great-grandfather.\nNot to assume it’s impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it’s humanly possible, you can do it too.\nIn the ring, our opponents can gouge us with their nails or butt us with their heads and leave a bruise, but we don’t denounce them for it or get upset with them or regard them from then on as violent types. We just keep an eye on them after that. Not out of hatred or suspicion. Just keeping a friendly distance.\nWe need to do that in other areas. We need to excuse what our sparring partners do, and just keep our distance—without suspicion or hatred.\nDeath. The end of sense-perception, of being controlled by our emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our bodies.\nTo escape imperialization—that indelible stain. It happens. Make sure you remain straightforward, upright, reverent, serious, unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind, affectionate, and doing your duty with a will. Fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you.\nRevere the gods; watch over human beings. Our lives are short. The only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts.\nYou take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or “bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad” to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies.\nDoes the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or Asclepius Demeter’s? And what about each of the stars—different, yet working in common?\nThe only thing that isn’t worthless: to live this life out truthfully and rightly. And be patient with those who don’t.\nWhen you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people around you have: this one’s energy, that one’s modesty, another’s generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are visibly embodied in the people around us, when we’re practically showered with them.\nIt’s good to keep this in mind.\nIt doesn’t bother you that you weigh only x or y pounds and not three hundred. Why should it bother you that you have only x or y years to live and not more? You accept the limits placed on your body. Accept those placed on your time.\nAmbition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do.\nSelf-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you.\nSanity means tying it to your own actions.\nPractice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get inside their minds.\nYou cannot quench understanding unless you put out the insights that compose it. But you can rekindle those at will, like glowing coals. I can control my thoughts as necessary; then how can I be troubled? What is outside my mind means nothing to it. Absorb that lesson and your feet stand firm.\nYou can return to life. Look at things as you did before. And life returns.\nNo matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”\nTo feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.\nTreat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them—that it would upset you to lose them.\n“ Then the only proper response for me to make is this: ‘You are much mistaken, my friend, if you think that any man worth his salt cares about the risk of death and doesn’t concentrate on this alone: whether what he’s doing is right or wrong, and his behavior a good man’s or a bad one’s.’ ”\nLook at the past—empire succeeding empire—and from that, extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from the rhythm of events.\nWhich is why observing life for forty years is as good as a thousand. Would you really see anything new?\nEverywhere, at each moment, you have the option:\nto accept this event with humility to treat this person as he should be treated to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in. Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take what’s left and live it properly.\nAnd this too: you don’t need much to live happily. And just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others, obeying God.\nTo live life in peace, immune to all compulsion. Let them scream whatever they want. Let animals dismember this soft flesh that covers you. How would any of that stop you from keeping your mind calm—reliably sizing up what’s around you—and ready to make good use of whatever happens? So that Judgment can look the event in the eye and say, “This is what you really are, regardless of what you may look like.” While Adaptability adds, “You’re just what I was looking for.” Because to me the present is a chance for the exercise of rational virtue—civic virtue—in short, the art that men share with gods. Both treat whatever happens as wholly natural; not novel or hard to deal with, but familiar and easily handled.\nThe gods live forever and yet they don’t seem annoyed at having to put up with human beings and their behavior throughout eternity. And not only put up with but actively care for them.\nAnd you—on the verge of death—you still refuse to care for them, although you’re one of them yourself.\nIf it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.\nBlame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming people get you?\nNo pointless actions.\nWhat dies doesn’t vanish. It stays here in the world, transformed, dissolved, as parts of the world, and of you. Which are transformed in turn—without grumbling.\nEverything is here for a purpose, from horses to vine shoots. What’s surprising about that? Even the sun will tell you, “I have a purpose,” and the other gods as well. And why were you born? For pleasure? See if that answer will stand up to questioning.\nJoy for humans lies in human actions.\nHuman actions: kindness to others, contempt for the senses, the interrogation of appearances, observation of nature and of events in nature.\nThree relationships:\ni. with the body you inhabit; ii. with the divine, the cause of everything in all things; iii. with the people around you.\nEither pain affects the body (which is the body’s problem) or it affects the soul. But the soul can choose not to be affected, preserving its own serenity, its own tranquillity. All our decisions, urges, desires, aversions lie within. No evil can touch them.\nYou have to assemble your life yourself—action by action. And be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can keep that from happening.\n—But there are external obstacles.…\nNot to behaving with justice, self-control, and good sense.\n—Well, but perhaps to some more concrete action.\nBut if you accept the obstacle and work with what you’re given, an alternative will present itself—another piece of what you’re trying to assemble. Action by action.\nHave you ever seen a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated head, just lying somewhere far away from the body it belonged to …? That’s what we do to ourselves—or try to—when we rebel against what happens to us, when we segregate ourselves. Or when we do something selfish.\nYou have torn yourself away from unity—your natural state, one you were born to share in. Now you’ve cut yourself off from it.\nBut you have one advantage here: you can reattach yourself. A privilege God has granted to no other part of no other whole—to be separated, cut away, and reunited. But look how he’s singled us out. He’s allowed us not to be broken off in the first place, and when we are he’s allowed us to return, to graft ourselves back on, and take up our old position once again: part of a whole.\nWe have various abilities, present in all rational creatures as in the nature of rationality itself. And this is one of them. Just as nature takes every obstacle, every impediment, and works around it—turns it to its purposes, incorporates it into itself—so, too, a rational being can turn each setback into raw material and use it to achieve its goal.\nDon’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don’t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer.\nThen remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present—and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits. And if your mind tries to claim that it can’t hold out against that … well, then, heap shame upon it.\nStop perceiving the pain you imagine and you’ll remain completely unaffected.\n—“You?”\nYour logos .\n—But I’m not just logos .\nFine. Just don’t let the logos be injured. If anything else is, let it decide that for itself.\nFor animate beings, “harmful” is whatever obstructs the operation of their senses—or the fulfillment of what they intend. Similar obstructions constitute harm to plants. So too for rational creatures, anything that obstructs the operation of the mind is harmful.\nApply this to yourself.\nDo pain and pleasure have their hooks in you? Let the senses deal with it. Are there obstacles to your action? If you failed to reckon with the possibility, then that would harm you, as a rational being. But if you use common sense, you haven’t been harmed or even obstructed. No one can obstruct the operations of the mind. Nothing can get at them—not fire or steel, not tyrants, not abuse—nothing. As long as it’s “ a sphere … in perfect stillness.”\nI have no right to do myself an injury. Have I ever injured anyone else if I could avoid it?\nPeople find pleasure in different ways. I find it in keeping my mind clear. In not turning away from people or the things that happen to them. In accepting and welcoming everything I see. In treating each thing as it deserves.\nLift me up and hurl me. Wherever you will. My spirit will be gracious to me there—gracious and satisfied—as long as its existence and actions match its nature.\nIs there any reason why my soul should suffer and be degraded—miserable, tense, huddled, frightened? How could there be?\nExternal things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.\nIf the problem is something in your own character, who’s stopping you from setting your mind straight?\nAnd if it’s that you’re not doing something you think you should be, why not just do it?\n—But there are insuperable obstacles.\nThen it’s not a problem. The cause of your inaction lies outside you.\n—But how can I go on living with that undone?\nThen depart, with a good conscience, as if you’d done it, embracing the obstacles too.\nNothing but what you get from first impressions. That someone has insulted you, for instance. That—but not that it’s done you any harm. The fact that my son is sick—that I can see. But “that he might die of it,” no. Stick with first impressions. Don’t extrapolate. And nothing can happen to you.\nOr extrapolate. From a knowledge of all that can happen in the world.\nNo carelessness in your actions. No confusion in your words. No imprecision in your thoughts. No retreating into your own soul, or trying to escape it. No overactivity.\nThey kill you, cut you with knives, shower you with curses. And that somehow cuts your mind off from clearness, and sanity, and self-control, and justice?\nA man standing by a spring of clear, sweet water and cursing it. While the fresh water keeps on bubbling up. He can shovel mud into it, or dung, and the stream will carry it away, wash itself clean, remain unstained.\nTo have that. Not a cistern but a perpetual spring.\nHow? By working to win your freedom. Hour by hour. Through patience, honesty, humility.\nNot to know what the world is is to be ignorant of where you are.\nNot to know why it’s here is to be ignorant of who you are. And what it is.\nNot to know any of this is to be ignorant of why you’re here.\nAnd what are we to make of anyone who cares about the applause of such people, who don’t know where or who they are?\nYou want praise from people who kick themselves every fifteen minutes, the approval of people who despise themselves. (Is it a sign of self-respect to regret nearly everything you do?)\nThe existence of evil does not harm the world. And an individual act of evil does not harm the victim. Only one person is harmed by it—and he can stop being harmed as soon as he decides to.\nOther people’s wills are as independent of mine as their breath and bodies. We may exist for the sake of one another, but our will rules its own domain. Otherwise the harm they do would cause harm to me. Which is not what God intended—for my happiness to rest with someone else.\nWe speak of the sun’s light as “pouring down on us,” as “pouring over us” in all directions. Yet it’s never poured out. Because it doesn’t really pour; it extends. Its beams (aktai ) get their name from their extension (ekteinesthai ).\nTo see the nature of a sunbeam, look at light as it falls through a narrow opening into a dark room. It extends in a straight line, striking any solid object that stands in its way and blocks the space beyond it. There it remains—not vanishing, or falling away.\nThat’s what the outpouring—the diffusion—of thought should be like: not emptied out, but extended. And not striking at obstacles with fury and violence, or falling away before them, but holding its ground and illuminating what receives it.\nWhat doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.\nTo enter others’ minds and let them enter yours.\nInjustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings for each other’s sake: to help—not harm—one another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of the gods.\nAnd to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the nature of that which is. And that which is and that which is the case are closely linked, so that nature is synonymous with Truth—the source of all true things. To lie deliberately is to blaspheme—the liar commits deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without realizing it. Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature—its order. He is in conflict with the way the world is structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is opposed to the truth—even against his will. Nature gave him the resources to distinguish between true and false. And he neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.\nAnd to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil—that too is blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound to find himself constantly reproaching nature—complaining that it doesn’t treat the good and bad as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the things that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things that produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s bound to happen, the world being what it is—and that again is blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly avoid wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.\nSome things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one over the other it would hardly have created both. And if we want to follow nature, to be of one mind with it, we need to share its indifference. To privilege pleasure over pain—life over death, fame over anonymity—is clearly blasphemous. Nature certainly doesn’t.\nAnd when I say that nature is indifferent to them, I mean that they happen indifferently, at different times, to the things that exist and the things that come into being after them, through some ancient decree of Providence—the decree by which from some initial starting point it embarked on the creation that we know, by laying down the principles of what was to come and determining the generative forces: existence and change, and their successive stages.\nDon’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.\nSo this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.\nOr perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel resentment toward them—in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be gentle with them—but keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s all that could restrain us (if anything could)—the only thing that could make\nus want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But now? Look how tiring it is—this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you say to death, “Come quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like them.”\nTo do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice—it degrades you.\nAnd you can also commit injustice by doing nothing.\nObjective judgment, now, at this very moment.\nUnselfish action, now, at this very moment.\nWilling acceptance—now, at this very moment—of all external events.\nThat’s all you need.\nAll things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a thing exists. All earthly things feel the earth’s tug. All wet things flow together. And airy things as well, so they have to be forcibly prevented from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn upward by that higher fire, but ready to ignite at the slightest touch of other, earthly flame. So that anything drier than usual makes good fuel, because less of what hinders combustion is mixed in with it.\nAnd things that share an intelligent nature are just as prone to seek out what is like them. If not more so. Because their superiority in other ways is matched by their greater readiness to mix and mingle with their counterparts.\nEven in irrational beings we see swarms and herds, and nesting, and love not unlike ours. Because they do have souls, and the bonding instinct is found in a developed form—not something we see in plants, or stones, or trees. And it’s still more developed in rational beings, with their states, friendships, families, groups, their treaties and truces. And in those yet\nmore developed there is a kind of unity even between separate things, the kind that we see in the stars. An advanced level of development can produce a sympathy even in things that are quite distinct.\nThings wait outside us, hover at the door. They keep to themselves. Ask them who they are and they don’t know, they can give no account of themselves.\nWhat accounts for them?\nThe mind does.\nLeave other people’s mistakes where they lie.\nWhen we cease from activity, or follow a thought to its conclusion, it’s a kind of death. And it doesn’t harm us. Think about your life: childhood, boyhood, youth, old age. Every transformation a kind of dying. Was that so terrible?\nThink about life with your grandfather, your mother, your adopted father. Realize how many other deaths and transformations and endings there have been and ask yourself: Was that so terrible?\nThen neither will the close of your life be—its ending and transformation.\nYou participate in a society by your existence. Then participate in its life through your actions—all your actions. Any action not directed toward a social end (directly or indirectly) is a disturbance to your life, an obstacle to wholeness, a source of dissension. Like the man in the Assembly—a faction to himself, always out of step with the majority.\nEndless suffering—all from not allowing the mind to do its job. Enough.\nDo what nature demands. Get a move on—if you have it in you—and don’t worry whether anyone will give you credit for it. And don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic; be satisfied with even the smallest progress, and treat the outcome of it all as unimportant.\nThat to be remembered is worthless. Like fame. Like everything.\nAll that you see will soon have vanished, and those who see it vanish will vanish themselves, and the ones who reached old age have no advantage over the untimely dead.\nEither the gods have power or they don’t. If they don’t, why pray? If they do, then why not pray for something else instead of for things to happen or not to happen? Pray not to feel fear. Or desire, or grief. If the gods can do anything, they can surely do that for us.\nNot “some way to sleep with her”—but a way to stop wanting to.\nNot “some way to get rid of him”—but a way to stop trying.\nNot “some way to save my child”—but a way to lose your fear.\nRedirect your prayers like that, and watch what happens.\nWhen you run up against someone else’s shamelessness, ask yourself this: Is a world without shamelessness possible?\nNo.\nThen don’t ask the impossible. There have to be shameless people in the world. This is one of them.\nThe same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other defect. Remembering that the whole class has to exist will make you more tolerant of its members.\nAnother useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has nature given us to counter that defect? As an antidote to unkindness it gave us kindness. And other qualities to balance other flaws.\nAnd when others stray off course, you can always try to set them straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something wrong—doing something the wrong way .\nAnd how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach—for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it—that a given person would act a given way—but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your\nnature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others—or help them to do something—we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.\nTo my soul:\nAre you ever going to achieve goodness? Ever going to be simple, whole, and naked—as plain to see as the body that contains you? Know what an affectionate and loving disposition would feel like? Ever be fulfilled, ever stop desiring—lusting and longing for people and things to enjoy? Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other place or country—“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to get along with? And instead be satisfied with what you have, and accept the present—all of it. And convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods, that things are good and always will be, whatever they decide and have in store for the preservation of that perfect entity—good and just and beautiful, creating all things, connecting and embracing them, and gathering in their separated fragments to create more like them.\nEverything that happens is either endurable or not.\nIf it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.\nIf it’s unendurable … then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well.\nJust remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.\nIn your interest, or in your nature.\nKeep in mind that “sanity” means understanding things—each individual thing—for what they are. And not losing the thread.\nAnd “cooperation” means accepting what nature assigns you—accepting it willingly.\nAnd “disinterest” means that the intelligence should rise above the movements of the flesh—the rough and the smooth alike. Should rise above fame, above death, and everything like them.\nIf you maintain your claim to these epithets—without caring if others apply them to you or not—you’ll become a new person, living a new life. To keep on being the person that you’ve been—to keep being mauled and degraded by the life you’re living—is to be devoid of sense and much too fond of life. Like those animal fighters at the games—torn half to pieces, covered in blood and gore, and still pleading to be held over till tomorrow … to be bitten and clawed again.\nHe has stripped away his body and—realizing that at some point soon he will have to abandon mankind and leave all this behind—has dedicated himself to serving justice in all he does, and nature in all that happens. What people say or think about him, or how they treat him, isn’t something he worries about. Only these two questions: Is what he’s doing now the right thing to be doing? Does he accept and welcome what he’s been assigned? He has stripped away all other occupations, all other tasks. He wants only to travel a straight path—to God, by way of law.\nHow they act when they eat and sleep and mate and defecate and all the rest. Then when they order and exult, or rage and thunder from on high. And yet, just consider the things they submitted to a moment ago, and the reasons for it—and the things they’ll submit to again before very long.\nWhen you look at yourself, see any of the emperors.\nAnd the same with everyone else. Then let it hit you: Where are they now?\nNowhere … or wherever.\nThat way you’ll see human life for what it is. Smoke. Nothing. Especially when you recall that once things alter they cease to exist through all the endless years to come.\nThen why such turmoil? To live your brief life rightly, isn’t that enough?\nThe raw material you’re missing, the opportunities …! What is any of this but training—training for your logos , in life observed accurately, scientifically.\nSo keep at it, until it’s fully digested. As a strong stomach digests whatever it eats. As a blazing fire takes whatever you throw on it, and makes it light and flame.\nNone of us have much time. And yet you act as if things were eternal—the way you fear and long for them.…\nBefore long, darkness. And whoever buries you mourned in their turn.\nSo too a healthy mind should be prepared for anything. The one that keeps saying, “Are my children all right?” or “Everyone must approve of me” is like eyes that can only stand pale colors, or teeth that can handle only mush.\nIt doesn’t matter how good a life you’ve led. There’ll still be people standing around the bed who will welcome the sad event.\nEven with the intelligent and good. Won’t there be someone thinking “Finally! To be through with that old schoolteacher. Even though he never said anything, you could always feel him judging you.” And that’s for a good man. How many traits do you have that would make a lot of people glad to be rid of you?\nRemember that, when the time comes. You’ll be less reluctant to leave if you can tell yourself, “This is the sort of life I’m leaving. Even the people around me, the ones I spent so much time fighting for, praying over, caring about—even they want me gone, in hopes that it will make their own lives easier. How could anyone stand a longer stay here?”\nAnd yet, don’t leave angry with them. Be true to who you are: caring, sympathetic, kind. And not as if you were being torn away from life. But the way it is when someone dies peacefully, how the soul is released from the body—that’s how you should leave them. It was nature that bound you to them—that tied the knot. And nature that now unties you.\nI am released from those around me. Not dragged against my will, but unresisting.\nThere are things that nature demands. And this is one of them.\nLearn to ask of all actions, “Why are they doing that?”\nStarting with your own.\nThat you’ve made enough mistakes yourself. You’re just like them.\nEven if there are some you’ve avoided, you have the potential.\nEven if cowardice has kept you from them. Or fear of what people would say. Or some equally bad reason.\nThat you don’t know for sure it is a mistake. A lot of things are means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can judge other people’s actions with real understanding.\nWhen you lose your temper, or even feel irritated: that human life is very short. Before long all of us will be laid out side by side.\nHow much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them.\nAnd along with not getting angry at others, try not to pander either. Both are forms of selfishness; both of them will do you harm. When you start to lose your temper, remember: There’s nothing manly about rage. It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being—and a man. That’s who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the angry whiners. To react like that brings you closer to impassivity—and so to strength. Pain is the opposite of strength, and so is anger. Both are things we suffer from, and yield to.…\nFour habits of thought to watch for, and erase from your mind when you catch them. Tell yourself:\nThis thought is unnecessary. This one is destructive to the people around you. This wouldn’t be what you really think (to say what you don’t think—the definition of absurdity). And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more divine part of you has been beaten and subdued by the degraded mortal part—the body and its stupid self-indulgence.\nAs you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper to yourself, “He may be dead in the morning.”\nDon’t tempt fate, you say.\nBy talking about a natural event? Is fate tempted when we speak of grain being reaped?\nEverything you’re trying to reach—by taking the long way round—you could have right now, this moment. If you’d only stop thwarting your own attempts. If you’d only let go of the past, entrust the future to Providence, and guide the present toward reverence and justice.\nReverence: so you’ll accept what you’re allotted. Nature intended it for you, and you for it.\nJustice: so that you’ll speak the truth, frankly and without evasions, and act as you should—and as other people deserve.\nIf you can cut yourself—your mind—free of what other people do and say, of what you’ve said or done, of the things that you’re afraid will happen, the impositions of the body that contains you and the breath within, and what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so that the mind is freed from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life on its own recognizance—doing what’s right, accepting what happens, and speaking the truth—\nIt never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god appeared to us—or a wise human being, even—and prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately shouting it out, we wouldn’t make it through a single day. That’s how much we value other people’s opinions—instead of our own.\n“But I’ve only gotten through three acts …!”\nYes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither was yours to determine.\nSo make your exit with grace—the same grace shown to you.",

    "content": "I took a lot of highlights with this one. Motivational, inspiring, and practical. I will be coming back to these notes over and over as I embark on my business ventures. Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. In fact, develop your asking powers like a muscle. Also, don’t try to figure out how to do something before you start. Just start and figure out how along the way.\nSummary and Highlights Ordinary people start profitable businesses every single day.\nYou do have problems, and so do your friends and every other person in this world. That’s all you need to generate million-dollar business ideas.\nChoose the three you think will be the most fun to work with.\nIn the early mornings, evenings, and weekends. Once you’ve validated an idea, and you’re pulling in enough to cover your minimum monthly expenses—aka the Freedom Number—then you can quit.\nI’ve started a few different businesses. They do okay and then I lose interest\nBut how will it scale? Focus on starting. Then figure out how to scale.\nYou will never feel 100 percent ready to start. You just need to start. Don’t buy another book or watch another video until you’ve worked through THIS process and started your million-dollar business.\nMarketing is easy when you have a product people want.\nFind a problem people are having that you can solve.\nCraft an irresistible solution whose million-dollar-plus potential is backed by simple market research.\nSpend NO MONEY to quickly validate whether your idea is the real deal (or not) by preselling it before you build it.\nDerailed by the same two fears:\nFEAR OF STARTING At some point people are told entrepreneurship is a huge risk, and you believed it. You figured more preparation, more planning, and more talking to friends Would help you overcome your insecurities. But that inaction only breeds more doubt and fear.\nThe best way to learn what we need to know—and become who we want to be—is by just getting started. Small EXPERIMENTS, repeated over time, are the recipe for transformation in business, and life.\nFEAR OF ASKING Soon after starting, the fear of rejection emerges.\nYou have some impressive skills, an amazing product, every advantage in the world, and you’ll never sell a thing if you can’t face another person and ask for what you want. Whether you want them to buy what you’re selling or help in another way, you have to be able to ask in order to get. Once you reframe rejection as something desirable, the act of asking becomes a power all its own.\nEverything you do in this book, and after, should be viewed as an experiment\nExperiments are supposed to fail.\nAnd should they fail, you just take what you’ve learned and try again a little bit differently.\nMost people never pick up the phone, most people never ask. And that’s what separates, sometimes, the people that do things from the people that just dream about them. You gotta act. And you gotta be willing to fail.\nBusiness is just a never-ending cycle of starting and trying new things, asking whether people will pay for those things, and then trying it again based on what you’ve learned. If you’re afraid to start or ask, you can’t experiment.\nAnd if you can’t experiment, you can’t do business.\nBusiness is an amazing opportunity to learn about yourself, play with ideas, solve your own problems, help other people, and get paid all the while.\nApproaching it this way will free up your imagination, make you less judgy and critical of yourself, and allow you to open yourself up to playful experimentation.\nLimiting time to a weekend forces you to become inventive, focuses your attention only on the things that matter, and shows you how much more you can do with limitations.\nThe most powerful growth tool today for solopreneurs is a system of content creation, audience building, and email marketing.\nYou’ll need a different approach and different system to organize your days—one that optimizes for your overall happiness above all else. (Or why do any of it, right?)\nThere are two mistakes one can make along the road to truth . . . not going all the way, and not starting. —Buddha\nFocus above all else on being a starter, an experimenter, a learner.\nDefining yourself by the things you do each day (the process) will get you to where you want to be quicker and more joyfully than measuring yourself against others.\nThe Magic of NOW, Not How. Fully embrace what I call the NOW, Not How Habit.\nMost people: Overthink first, act later. Every successful entrepreneur: Act first, figure it out later. Any analysis ahead of action is purely speculation.\nA simple mission to hit a monthly revenue number is the most effective form of early motivation.\nYou first need to choose your Freedom Number.\nWhat can YOU do in your business to make money this week? Today? Right now?\nIf you commit to nothing, you’ll be distracted by everything.\nThe Freedom Number helps us not get lost in abstraction or complexity; it reminds us the mechanics of business are simple.\nChoosing your Freedom Number. Start by choosing a short-term monthly revenue goal—your Freedom Number—and make it a number that doesn’t scare you.\nWho you are, what you have, and what you know right now are more than enough to get going.\nLove rejections! Collect them like treasure! Set rejection goals. I shoot for a hundred rejections each week, because if you work that hard to get so many noes, in them you will find a few yeses, too.\nThe upside of asking is unlimited and the downside is minimal.\nBe persistent. almost every no you get can eventually become a yes. Persistence will reveal that most noes are actually a “not now.”\nFollow Up! Studies show that if you initially get a no, your follow-up ask is TWICE as likely to get a yes.\nSelling is helping.\nIf you believe your product or service improves the lives of your customers, sales is just education.\nIf you believe your product or service can fulfill a true need, it’s your moral obligation to sell it.—Zig Ziglar\nThree Ws of business:\nWho you are selling to What problem you’re solving Where they are Sell ideas to a small early adopter group before you’ve built the product (or spent a cent) in order to validate that there is a market that will pay.\nWhen in doubt, solve your own problems. If you are willing to pay for a solution, it’s likely others are, too. And at least you’ll have one happy customer—yourself.\nMinimum viable product or MVP. Create the simplest possible version of what you’re offering and start selling it right away.\nThat way, instead of endlessly refining something in a vacuum, you use feedback from actual customers to incrementally develop an offering people absolutely want to buy.\nCreate opportunities within the context of who they are, what they know, and especially who they know.\nValidation process begins with potential customers in the entrepreneur’s orbit. Actual people with names. Tribes you belong to or are interested in, most of whom are already self-organized online.\nWho do you have easy access to that you’d be EXCITED to help?\nThe better you understand your target group, the better you can speak to them. The more specifically you can speak to their problems, the better and easier you can sell or test products.\nThis process prioritizes communication with people, through starting (taking the first iteration of your solution straight to customers) and asking (engaging them in a conversation to determine how your solution can best fix their problem). Business creation should always be a conversation.\nBecome a Problem Seeker The best entrepreneurs are the most dissatisfied. They’re always thinking of how things can be better.\nYour frustrations—and the frustrations of others—are your business opportunities\nThe crucial first step toward entrepreneurship is to study your own unhappiness and to think of solutions (aka business opportunities) for you to sell.\nWhat’s the most painful (aka valuable) problem you can solve for people . . . That you also have passion for and/or unique expertise in . . . For the largest niche possible that you belong to and understand.\nFocus on your Zone of Influence here (your existing community):\nSolve Your Own Problems What is one thing this morning that irritated me?\nWhat is one thing on my to-do list that’s been there over a week?\nWhat is one thing that I regularly fail to do well?\nWhat is one thing I wanted to buy recently only to find out that no one made it?\nKeep a notebook close by and jot down things that bother you.\nIt’s easier to sell to a large group of people who’ve already spent money on a product or service.\nBestsellers are your best friends. Accessorize an existing product.\nWrite down all the bad, crazy, and nonsense ideas that come into your mind.\nStudying the marketplaces where people are TRYING to spend money\nSearch Engine Queries\nIt’s much easier to sell something when people ALREADY want it. There are 3 billion Google searches every day, giving you a direct line to customers’ thoughts and needs\nAnswerThePublic.com will find the most googled questions around whatever keyword you input.\nIs the potential solution a vitamin (a nice-to-have) or a painkiller (a must-have)?\nr/SomebodyMakeThis\nTwo key questions to answer to make sure it’s a million-dollar opportunity:\nIs the overall market dying, flat, or growing? You want flat or ideally growing! Is this a million-dollar opportunity? To figure that out, we have to know the number of potential customers and the price of your product.\nI use Google Trends and Facebook Ads to answer those questions.\nEvaluate the size and growth potential of my target market.\nIs the market growing or dying? Search Google Trends.\nHow many potential customers are there? Use Facebook Ads to research your market size. They let you type in the keyword of whatever business category you’re thinking about and see the approximate audience size.\nYou can also use the Facebook Ads Library to see every single active ad running on Facebook for your keyword and location, which is super helpful for uncovering competitors and getting ideas for your own marketing efforts other groups you could think of targeting.\nOther categories to search:\nLocals More niche Demographics-based Step 2. Is This a Million-Dollar Opportunity? Pick a price point you think will be ideal for your customer.\nMultiply that by the number of ideal customers. Does that equal at least a million dollars? Yes or no? evaluate that\nGoogle Trends: Flat with some growth\nSize of market: 2,500,000 people\nCost of your product: $50\nTotal Value: $125,000,000\nMillion-dollar idea? YES!\nDon’t be a wantrepreneur and waste time calculating revenue to the exact cent or fretting about the optimal price point\nAll you want is to know if the business idea is worth pursuing\nNow that we know it’s worth it, let’s confirm how exactly you’re going to get your million dollars.\nStep 3. The One-Minute Business Model\nRealistically you’re not going to get 5 or 10 percent of this market, BUT now let’s see what it would take to generate your own $1 million in profit.\nRevenue – Cost = Profit. These determine if\nyou can make your first million dollars\nRevenue (all the money you make) – Cost (how much it costs to make it) = Profit (what you get to take home) This is obviously extremely basic, but that’s the point. It’s all you need to calculate in order\nto assess whether you can get to $1 million\nWhat we are looking for are rough estimates. Momentum is your friend, and we can sweat the details later\ndivide your target profit by the profit\nThis is ONLY the number of people we see via Facebook. This is for only one beard product. If you find success with beard oil, you can easily repeat the process many times with other grooming products\nThis is only the first sale to these customers\nIt’s far easier to sell to an existing customer than it is to acquire new ones, so once we’ve built up a decent customer base, we can make\neven more products to sell to them. Plus, you can likely sell a subscription to increase the amount you sell per customer. PRO TIP: When you’re launching a business, always ask yourself: is this going to be a one-off purchase, something\ncustomers buy here and there when they want to consume it, or can you make it a monthly recurring sale?\nIt’s always better to be in the reorder business\nStep 4. Pivot and Evolve—Your Revenue Dials\nAlmost every successful business had to pivot or change course along the way\nMaybe you chose the wrong market to begin with. Or maybe one feature of your offer turns out to be the thing people want. Just keep your eyes open for adjacent opportunities.\nThe easiest way for me to reach my goal was to increase the average order value by selling longer-term subscriptions to businesses\nsix Revenue Dials you can use:\nAverage order value: Increase the amount someone purchases.\nFrequency: Increase how often someone will buy your service.\nPrice point: Increase or decrease your price point to affect total sales.\nCustomer type: Approach a more lucrative/wealthier customer segment.\nProduct line: Add additional products to make the business more attractive to start.\nAdd-on services: If you’re selling a product like cookies, can you offer a service like setting up birthday parties\nor cooking at the person’s home?\nThe hard part is not choosing which business idea. The hard part is getting customers. And that’s where you’ll focus first.\nPick one business idea. Make sure it’s a million-dollar opportunity. Confirm your business idea is profitable\nstart with the problem that is most exciting for you to solve yourself\nWhen you have money from customers, fulfillment is easy. Be worried when it’s the other way around\nyou’ll never know if they can go from idea to business until you actually test your target market’s willingness to pay.\nValidation is finding three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you money for your idea.\nbenefits of Validation\nYou don’t waste time.\nYou save money.\nYou find out if you can actually get customers for your idea.\nYou get money up front.\nYou light a fire under your butt to get moving.\nthe Golden Rule of Validation:\nFind three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you money for your idea.\nwhy it works so well:\nYou’re allowed only forty-eight hours. Limitations breed creativity. Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting wantrepreneur inside you and force you to iterate\nfast and be creative until you find something that works. Get your first three customers. Your first customer is a friend, the second customer is someone in your family, but your third customer is HARD\nCollect money up front. The promise of payment is not validation. That’s polite rejection. Getting customers to hand over their dollars makes it real\nif you can get someone to give you money quickly just by describing a product or solution, you’re good! You’re not trying to invent demand; you’re trying to see how\nEXCITED people are about what you’re helping them with.\nThree Methods to Validate ANY Business Idea\n1. Direct Preselling\nmake real contact with real people, tell them what I’m selling, ask for money, and see how they react\nActively preselling your first few customers is the best way for entrepreneurs to launch a business.\ncreate a spreadsheet with ten\nrows\nThese are going to be your Dream Ten prospects: ideal people you want to validate your business idea with.[*]\nHere are the columns to use:\nName\nCompany\nPhone\nEmail\nWhen contacted\nWhen to follow up\nNotes\nMake it easy: start with your best friends who might be interested—your Zone of Influence. Too often, people make it hard by going outside their spheres. They do this to avoid rejection, when in reality your network\nwants to help you succeed\nCheck out your Facebook friend list, your Facebook groups, your favorites on contacts, LinkedIn Connections, former colleagues, past clients, text message lists, people from your church or synagogue, your Twitter followers\nand others who fit your ideal customer\nBy the time you’ve done this you should\nhave filled out at least ten lines, your Dream Ten.\nBUT if you’re thinking, Dang, I don’t know ten people who can buy this, then maaaaaaaaybe you should a consider a different business idea\nHoping and praying that a thousand people in\nthe world will magically buy it is living in la-la land, as my father would put it. Go after markets and businesses where you have influence so it’s easier to succeed\nScripts for Preselling Your Idea\nValidation is a conversation. Not a sales pitch, but a chat to learn about the\ncustomer, see if you can help them and if they’ll actually pay you\nFor this reason, with your Dream Ten, I really recommend you turn the ask into an exploratory conversation, to allow for more learning.\nThese people really know you and they’ll be happy to give you time, so use it to extract what most excites them about your product or not so you can tweak it.\nprocess to validate your solution with your Dream Ten can be broken down to a three\npart framework:\nListen Options Transition First, Listen\nget customers talking about their problem.\nHere are three questions that will help you in this process:\nWhat’s the most frustrating thing about what’s currently going on? How would having X make your life better? What do you think that X should cost? Finish with summarizing what the person\nsaid. For example, Daniel would say, “So you want an easier way to learn how to use your computer.”\nPRO TIP: Use what or how questions to encourage a more open dialogue versus\nwhy or yes/no questions, which can limit your learning\nIt’s crucial to really listen and write down their problems, because you’re looking for the pain they’re feeling and how valuable it would be for them to give you money\nThe bigger the pain, the bigger the opportunity!\nNext, Options. Now that you’ve uncovered the problem, it’s time to suggest options that can solve their problems—and what they’d pay for it\nYou’re looking for excitement and a willingness to pay. Eye rolls and lower energy\nfrom your prospective customer are indicators of low interest\nNow, Transition. You know their problem and you know an option to fix it that they are excited about. Now it’s time to transition to the sell.\nIf they pay you, that’s Validation success\nOften you can distill your offer down to three parts: Price + Benefit\nTime. Strung together, they form an offer sentence. Other examples:\nFor $25, I will teach you how to save an hour a day on your Mac, in just twenty minutes\nFor $69, I will teach you how to write better in two hours\nFor $10, I will send you a PDF with ten mind hacks that will change the\nway you think in ten minutes. For $180, I will provide six months of tasty jerky to your office this week PRO TIP: Presenting your offer as a\ncomparison can make it easier for your customer to understand. “We are like X but Y.”\nFor example, we are like your competitor but twice as cheap\nWhen you validate, you have to get comfortable with potentially selling a product before you’ve actually made it. Clearly explain when it will be delivered. Because people are fine with giving you money in advance, as long as you set clear expectations\nmoney:\n“Sign up now while it’s still at a discounted price, x percent of y dollars [and you’ll be grandfathered in at that price forever]. This offer is only good today.”\nPRO TIP: Always follow up by sending an email to your first customers asking for feedback. Feedback is a gift you can continually use to improve yourself and your business\nOf course, success won’t always be so immediate when you use direct preselling to validate—in fact, you’ll get rejected a whole lot—and this is another instance where the technique shines.\nThat’s because every rejection is an\nopportunity; you can use it to take a deep dive into customer problems\nWhen I get shot down while validating, I have a simple four-question script that flips the no into new knowledge, new ideas, and maybe even new customers\nWhy not?” It’s really easy to get scared from attacking this one head-on, because what happens if their criticism is right? But that’s exactly\nwhat you want to know!\n“Who is one person you know who would really like this?” Always, always, always ask for a referral! Be specific about what kind of referral and use a number; this\nmakes it highly effective.\n“What would make this a no-brainer for you?” If they don’t want your product, maybe they’d want something related to it. If they don’t want to pay for your dog care app\nwhat about dog walking? A dog hotel? Dog dating?\nWhat would you pay for that?” One of the hardest things in a startup is setting prices. Getting potential customers to say what\nthey’d pay is pure gold!\nPRO TIP: Active communications—calls and texts—work a lot better than\npassive ones, like posting on Facebook or Twitter and waiting for replies. Try to Direct Message (DM) people, or whatever enables you to get the fastest response time possible.\n2. Marketplaces\nA classic way to validate your product is to use marketplaces—sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, Reddit, or whatever you have locally. The\n3. Landing Pages\nOne really popular approach is to set up a\nsimple landing page using a cheap or free service. Currently Instapage, Unbounce, and ClickFunnels are popular landing page tools. Find the latest landing page tools at MillionDollarWeekend.com\nThen they run a bunch of ads to send\npeople to the site and see if people actually will enter an email address to get on the mailing list, or even preorder the product\nThe reason I don’t love this approach is you have to spend time setting it up and buying ads, and when you buy ads, you have to become an\nad expert. The whole experience is slow and costly. Two things I hate.\nThe key is: If you go this route, don’t overthink the design, the name, the\nlanguage, the ads, or any of that. Just focus on seeing if you can get people to buy your product!\nYour challenge is to get at least three paying customers within forty-eight hours.

Consultants love to stand on a soapbox at LinkedIn. Journalists, marketers, and others like the few hundred characters of Twitter.\nDesigners can show off their work at Dribble\nAuthors can start a blog for free on WordPress.com\nYou need to know three things to choose:\nWhich site has the audience you want to connect with? What medium do YOU enjoy creating content in? What disproportionate results will you get compared to the work you\nput in?\nlet’s break down how I chose my platform. To start, I eliminated the ones that don’t work for me.\nInstagram: I don’t take a lot of pics\nPodcasting\ngrowing that audience relative to the work involved was near impossible\nA limited number of people listen to podcasts, and currently, discovering new podcasts is nearly impossible\nLinkedIn: Great audience of businesspeople, but it’s incredibly noisy, and going viral on it is really tough.\nBlogging:\nThe work of posting\ndoesn’t drive as many viral shares anymore because more of the audience is spending their time directly on social media\nTwitter\nthe audience isn’t growing—their monthly users have been flat for years\nGoing viral works there, but getting people\noff the platform and buying on yours is tough\nTikTok\n1 million followers there or 100,000 on YouTube? Not equivalent. I’d take YouTube every time.\nstart with just one as an experiment.\nThe key principle is to start right now to build your audience and then move them to your email list\nUpdate your bio.Choose your one platform, and using the unique angle pitch you wrote out before, clean up and rewrite your profile/bio on that platform to reflect who you are and how you help your ideal\ncustomer\nCore Circle: Start with a very narrow audience. Ali started with the medical school exams for British\npeople. Your niche within a niche can be the most obscure thing imaginable, as long as it makes you and your audience passionate\nMedium Circle: As you move bigger, your content should overlap\nsomewhat with what concerns your Core Circle, but it should appeal to a broader audience. Ali started talking about studying and productivity in general, since that’s required for all students.\nLarge Circle: Here you go for the largest audience possible that’s still related. Some of Ali’s most watched videos are about his salary—made possible by his medical video fame—or the latest Apple product—which he\nuses to increase productivity. All the circles should still include your core audience but keep expanding your circle of influence\nTo get started, identify a value that a specific group of people—your Core Circle—want and become a reliable source of information for\nthem. Here’s a formula you can use—outcome you’ll deliver + target market.\nexample\nCore Circle: How to clean your evaporative cooler + in the Southwest\nUSA\nMedium Circle: How to choose laundry detergents + for new homeowners. Large Circle: The ten best vacuums + for a family\nOnce you have your outcome and market figured, you need to find a unique viewpoint in your niche.\nTo come up with your unique viewpoint, ask yourself a few questions\nWhat is something everyone thinks is true—but you think is wrong\nWhat is something nobody in your target market is talking about—but should be?\nWhat are the biggest mistakes people in your market are making—but are totally blind to?\nThink back to your validation days: Who are the customers you want to appeal to and what’s the outcome you can create content for? What’s the unique point of view in your content they’d be excited to hear about?\nFormula = Outcome you’ll deliver + the target marketCore Circle: Medium Circle: Large Circle\nBe the Guide, Not the Guru\ntitled “How I . . .” rather than “How to . . .”\nThe goal here is to document what YOU do, not what you think everyone else should do\nWhen you position yourself as\nsomeone who is on a journey and document your process and your progress, you become relatable, and that is what audiences long for\nSome of my most popular videos feature me failing, often.

But I want to show you an easier way:Here’s how I built AppSumo.com for\n$50.Enjoy,Noah\nSecond, with the Connection Email, you’re explicitly asking them to connect with you on social media, by following you on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and so on\nCHALLENGESet up an autoresponder.I happen to think SendFox.com (I helped build it) is pretty darned good, but there are a bunch of others that I recommend, like ConvertKit.com and\nMailchimp.com\nThe Law of 100\nWhatever you put yourself to, do it 100 times before you even THINK of stopping\nThis stops you from succumbing to what Seth\nGodin calls “the dip,” the moment in a long slog between starting and when mastery sets in where you start hating the work and you want to quit.\nLean in and commit to 100 reps. (Think of this as doing reps and practicing as opposed to failing or succeeding.) This changes your mindset and makes it much easier to sustain forward motion when\nthings get tough\nset up a system that helps you get your 100 reps done without thinking about the results.\nOnce that’s done, you can decide whether\nyou want to give it up or not\nThe Law of 100 is about the power of consistency—the only way to get to greatness.\nCHALLENGEThe Law of 100.\nCommit to doing 100 emails, posts, or whatever action will move you closer to your goals. To live up to your commitment, use the Law of 100 Grid below to track your progress—and don’t break the chain!\nfive exact questions to create your own marketing plan\nWhat is your one goal for this year?\nWho exactly is your customer and\nwhere can you find them?\nWhat is one marketing activity you can double down on?\nHow can you delight your first 100 customers?\nIf you HAD to double your business with no money in thirty days, what would you do?\nSet a single hyper-focused exact goal\nFirst off, you need to set a goal. That means choosing a number\nemail addresses\nmonthly Freedom Number\n1,000 YouTube subscribers $1 million in net revenue Fifty clients how much and by when? Now add a time frame.\nwithout a time frame, there’s no urgency\n“I want to be worth $1 million in three years.”\nCreate your Marketing Experiment List\nBefore you paddle quickly in the wrong direction, we MUST quickly try different marketing experiments to figure out which\nones we can double down on\nThe best way to do this is by using an Experiment-Based Marketing list to plan and track your marketing strategies\nWORK BACKWARDS FROM YOUR GOAL!\nIf you could use only two of the marketing activities, what would they be?”\nWho is your ideal customer? Where are they? Who is your ideal customer?\nThink about what’s in common with\nyour existing customers. Certain age? Common interest? Specific gender? Certain hobbies? From a specific area?\nCHALLENGE\nWho’s your customer?Describe to me who your ideal customer is.The MORE specific the better. Think about their gender, age, location, and anything else that makes them unique.\nNext, where can you find more of these ideal customers?\nLook where you found your previous ones and ask your existing customers!\nexact message I still send to people to this day:\nHey Maria,Thank you so much for being a customer.Where’s the one specific place you’d\nexpect to learn about my product? Now make a list of these places where we can find more of these people.\nlist of generic marketing ideas to get you going:\nContacting your network: The number one place you should look for customers is in your own existing network. The benefit is that people already know you, so making the sale is easier.\nPaid ads: Reach out to potential\ncustomers on search engines like Bing and Google, so your name will appear when certain keywords are searched.\nSocial ads: Target your audience through ads on social channels like Twitter and Facebook, Reddit, TikTok\nor LinkedIn.\nContent marketing: Create and publish content (blogs, podcasts, videos) with the goal of generating interest in your product/service\nCold outreach: Speak directly to potential customers. This could mean picking up the phone and calling potential customers or sending cold emails to prospects.\nTarget market blogs: Sponsor\nposts and content on popular blogs within your target market.\nInfluencer marketing: Identify and build relationships with individuals who have influence over your target market (for example, high\nprofile bloggers or Instagrammers).\nPR: Pitch the press and bloggers in your niche to cover your story.\nSEO: Search engine optimization is another reliable way to grow your\ntraffic, but it takes time. Do some keyword research on sites like AnswerThePublic or SpyFu to discover what people in your niche are talking about. Create hyper-targeted content to drive traffic.\nGiveaways: Round up some epic prizes, create a sweepstakes page . . . and promote the shit out of it. Collaborations: Appear on other podcasts/shows/newsletters/YouTube channels\nAfter you figured out your marketing ideas lists, we need to estimate expected sales from these ideas.\nSetting your expected sales is one of the most important parts of your strategy. These\ntargets will give you something to measure against and help you identify where you can double down in the future.\nSo how do you go about setting targets for your sources?\nThe most important aspect of this process is\nnot to worry about being exact. It’s to make decent guesses so you can have a framework to prioritize and double down on your sources.\nWhen setting your targets, the trick is to use your BEST GUESS; it doesn’t have to be a super-accurate number. It’s all to help you PRIORITIZE\nyour marketing activities. Over time, you’ll get better at this.\nHere’s an example for thirty days of sales:\nMarketing Experiments\nExpected Sales\n1. SEO: Write four blog posts\n10\n2. Contact everyone in my network\n25\n3. Call my aunt Rhonda\n1\n4. Post in Meetup group\n5\n5. Post flyer\n9\nTotal\n40\nThis spreadsheet helps you prioritize your time by focusing on the largest expected sales items first.\nAnother option is to add a column for Time: how long it will take you to do the different activities. You can use this to see which\nactivities will not take much time but still get sales.\nAlso, you can consider including cost if you’re doing ads, but I encourage people to not spend money on marketing at first. Exhaust your free options.\nCHALLENGEWhere are your customers?Now list at least five places your customers are and how many sales in thirty days you think you can get from them\n3. Double down on what works.\nThere’s a golden rule to marketing tactics I want you to repeat after me:\nFind what works and double down on it; find what doesn’t work and kill it.\nthere’s nothing wrong with experimenting and trying new channels—but you need to set time limits to stop if something isn’t working. I find thirty days is more than enough to get results from your marketing experiments.\nThat’s why for an entrepreneur it’s important to have a lazy mindset. If something’s too hard and not working after a good try? Give up and move on!\nDouble down on the experiments that work the best.\nrest: I stopped doing every other channel and went all in on YouTube.\nCHALLENGE\nWhat marketing strategies can I double down on?Let’s update your original marketing experiments sheet with actual sales. This should make it obvious which experiments to double down on and which ones to kill.\nBUT instead of focusing ONLY on your new\ncustomers, let’s take advantage of the ones you already have\n4. Make Your First 100 Customers Happier\nHow would you double your business if you COULD NOT get any new customers?\nThis will help you think of ways you can overdeliver to your current customers. Because the biggest growth lever in business is customer retention and referrals. If you’re just starting out, every referral can literally double your business.\nexamples\nreplied to every YouTube comment. This made the audience feel special and connected to me.\ngave my personal phone number to every customer even when we were making $20-million-plus a year\nI personally write to customers to see what they like and dislike about us\nWhat made you interested in buying Imgur?-What other websites/services would you want big discounts on?-Any suggestions or things you would have wanted to see on our website, appsumo.com?\nFeel free to spread the word\nThe other key is to keep overdelivering and make your current customers as happy as possible. The benefits of this are twofold:\nHappy customers will refer your business to their friends Happy customers are more likely to spend more cash and buy your new products or services.\nThe longer you retain customers, the more opportunity you have to earn more revenue from them.\nevery step of the way you can get feedback to make your product or service even better\nAsk your customers this: “What is one thing we can do today that will make you twice as happy with us?”\nCHALLENGEMake your customers happy.Ask one customer: “What is one thing I\ncan do today that will make you twice as happy with us?”\nIn your MDW journal, answer these five questions:\nWhat is your one goal for this year?\nWho exactly is your customer and where can you find them?\nWhat is one marketing activity\nyou can double down on?\nHow can you delight your first 100 customers?\nIf you HAD to double your\nbusiness with no money in thirty days, what would you do?\nreasons I became an entrepreneur. To live my life, my way\nthe first step to getting all you want in the world is allowing yourself to want it—and facing the fears necessary to be able to get what you want.\nCHALLENGELet’s share your story of\nsuccess to help others\nSend an email to noah@MillionDollarWeekend.com or post on social media and tag me @noahkagan\nBringing Out Your Dreams\nIn a j-o-b, you must accept the system you are in. As an entrepreneur, you get to design your own system\nThe challenge of your business—and your life—is designing a system that optimizes for your overall happiness\nDream Year Checklist\nstart by writing down how you’d love this year to turn out for you. This Dream Year isn’t just “I’m gonna have a nice\nhouse and my business will rock it.” Include the specifics—where you’re living, what you’re doing, how you feel, where you travel to, etc.\nThis is to inspire you about all the things you can do in your life. Then really dial in the ones that feel important to you\nThis is a DREAM YEAR. That means dreaming big and not worrying about the how. All you’re doing right now is creating a vision for the year that fills you with excitement\nOnce you have a clear picture of your Dream Year, then you can focus on making it come true.\nInstead of being reactive throughout the year and getting thrown off course, you have a chance to focus on what would be an incredible\nyear for YOU and to write it all down.\nCHALLENGEWrite out your Dream Year.Make the checklist detailed and\nspecific\nTurn Your Dream Year into Goals\nNow that you have created your Dream Year, it’s time to take your dreams and choose\nand organize them into your goals. This is your life, so PICK the things from your dream list you’re MOST excited about. Another key thing is consistency—it’s a GOOD thing if you’re continuing goals from previous years. Also, I prefer to have fewer things to accomplish but\nI’m very excited to do them.\nCategorize them into four sections: Work, Health, Personal, and Travel.\nBut feel free to change or add to these however you’d like, it’s YOUR life!\nHere are the ones I picked from the above\nyear:\nWork:\n$30 million for AppSumo 500,000 YouTube subscribers Finish Million Dollar Weekend book\nHealth:\nBike across America\n75,000 push-ups\nPersonal:\nComplete pilot’s license and fly to Albuquerque\nEither donate all the money you make or spend it on yourself and friends\nGet a nice house in Austin\nTravel\nDo one week of solo travel Visit a mountain biking city (Asheville, Sun Valley, Jackson Hole, Sedona) Trip with parents and brother Key things about your goals:\nDon’t worry about doing everything in your dream year. Really think about which ones would excite you. My rule of thumb is if you’re hesitating on the dream, then it shouldn’t make your goals list. I don’t always accomplish everything on my lists every year. And that’s okay. This list is to help you prioritize your time, which we’ll talk about next. You can schedule and make sure you are working toward the things you really want to do\nOver the past ten years I’ve tried to set super-aggressive goals, but I’ve\nfound that it’s better to aim for more sustainable goals. It’s more impressive to find and stick with something than burn out after being impressive for one year\nThis list works for you, not the\nother way around. If midyear you realize something doesn’t matter, change it. I aim to review and update this list only twice a year\nThe best way to make sure you accomplish your goals is to see them often\nFind one person to send your yearly goals to.This can be someone who invested $1 in you early on, a friend . . . anyone you trust to check in with you regularly and\nchallenge you on your BS as they help you follow through on your promises\nCHALLENGE\nYearly goals list.Use the four categories to flush out your yearly goals.Work Health\nPersonal Travel\nColoring Your Calendar\nIf you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.—Benjamin Franklin\nPut everything in a Category. Assign a Color Code to your categories. Schedule with color your key weekly priorities. Perform a weekly Sunday accountability (p)review.\nBlue = Work Green = Health Purple = Personal Yellow = Travel questions I use to prioritize my time:\n1. How do I pick what to actually do\neach week?\nEvery Sunday, I spend fifteen minutes looking over the past week and setting my tasks for the next one\n2. How do I know if these tasks are moving me in the right direction of my goal?\n3. What if I want to be lazy, do I need to schedule it?\n4. How can I double down on activities that move me toward my goals?\nNever Entrepreneur Alone\nGreat entrepreneurs have great entrepreneurial communities. There’s no such thing as self-made. Everyone is team\nmade\nthree ways to meet the right people to help you on your business journey\n1. Get an Accountability Buddy\nWe make better choices and work harder when someone else is observing our behavior. Researchers call it the Hawthorne effect. I call it my number one productivity hack.\nFind someone you respect, probably a peer working toward similar goals, and establish this Sunday ritual to help each other on your journeys\nCHALLENGEAccountability buddy.My accountability buddy is:\nFind one person to send your weekly goals to. For the past ten years, I’ve worked\nwith Adam Gilbert from mybodytutor.com every week on my yearly goals. Accountability is a superpower. Go to MillionDollarWeekend.com and join our newsletter. I’ll try to connect you with an accountability buddy.\nYou found an accountability buddy, but how can you meet others to help you succeed at business? Here are two ways that work!\n2. Target Prefluencers\nI always make an effort to connect with ambitious people BEFORE they make it. It’s so\nmuch easier to connect with them, help each other, and build actual relationships.\nHere are three principles to help you find Prefluencers:\nWho’s doing work you’re impressed by? AND who doesn’t have a ton of attention and is likely to reply? AND what can you do to help this person? CHALLENGEConnect with a Prefluencer.The easiest way to connect with anyone is to compliment them first WITHOUT asking for anything in return.The Prefluencer I’m reaching out to\nSend this message:Hey [first name],LOVING what you’re putting out. [Insert specifically what you liked or how it impacted your life]Keep going!\nFrom here, the person will likely respond and you can open up a dialogue to talk about working together or helping each other in the future\nrelationships like the above script is just sending a compliment without any expectations.\n3. Build Your VIP Network with Referrals\nAfter meeting someone new, Andrew would send them a thank-you email. In it, he would include:\nHighlights from the chat he found interesting Follow-ups and to-dos Request to meet more people When he got a new list of people to meet, Andrew would send an intro email with three\nkey points:\nShort blurb about himself Value he could provide (that is to say, what’s in it for them?) Why he was excited to meet them\nTelling someone why you are interesting\nhow you can help, and why you want to meet works like gangbusters. If you fail to include these points for the person you’re reaching out to, expect to be ignored\nCHALLENGEAsk your friends for one referral.\nTell me the first person that comes to mind. Who’s the most\nimpressive friend you know?\nSend this message to that friend:\nHey \u003cfriend\u003eYou are the most impressive friend I\nknow and I’d love your help in expanding my network.I love: VR, 3D printers, email marketing.Who’s one person you think I should connect with?If no one comes to mind, no pressure\nI like asking for just one person to make it easier to think about. And then say no pressure on the other person vs give them an assignment of having to introduce me to someone\nAfter you’ve had a great meeting\nwith that person, thank your original friend and ask the new one for a referral.",

Nextcloud dependencies:\nPHP 8.3 Apache sql database (This tutorial uses MariaDB) Official docs: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html\nSetting up dependencies Install latest supported PHP I used this guide to help get a supported php version. As php 2 installed from dnf repos by default: https://orcacore.com/php83-installation-almalinux9-rockylinux9/\nMake sure dnf is up to date:\nsudo dnf update -y sudo dnf upgrade -y Set up the epel repository:\nsudo dnf install epel-release -y Set up remi to manage php modules:\nsudo dnf install -y dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-9.rpm sudo dnf update -y Remove old versions of php:\nsudo dnf remove php* -y List available php streams:\nsudo dnf module list reset php -y Last metadata expiration check: 1:03:46 ago on Sun 29 Dec 2024 03:34:52 AM MST. AlmaLinux 9 - AppStream Name Stream Profiles Summary php 8.1 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language php 8.2 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language Remi's Modular repository for Enterprise Linux 9 - x86_64 Name Stream Profiles Summary php remi-7.4 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language php remi-8.0 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language php remi-8.1 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language php remi-8.2 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language php remi-8.3 [e] common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language php remi-8.4 common [d], devel, minimal PHP scripting language Enable the correct stream:\nsudo dnf module enable php:remi-8.3 Now the default to install is version 8.3, install it like this:\nsudo dnf install php -y php -v Let’s install git, as it’s also needed in this setup: sudo dnf -y install git\nInstall Composer for managing php modules:\ncd \u0026\u0026 curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer Install needed PHP modules: sudo dnf install php-process php-zip php-gd php-mysqlnd\nUpgrade php memory limit: sudo vim /etc/php.ini\nmemory_limit = 512M Apache setup Add Apache config for vhost: sudo vim /etc/httpd/conf.d/nextcloud.conf\n\u003cVirtualHost *:80\u003e DocumentRoot /var/www/nextcloud/ ServerName {subdomain}.{example}.com \u003cDirectory /var/www/nextcloud/\u003e Require all granted AllowOverride All Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews \u003cIfModule mod_dav.c\u003e Dav off \u003c/IfModule\u003e \u003c/Directory\u003e \u003c/VirtualHost\u003e Set up the mysql database Install: sudo dnf install mariadb-server -y\nEnable the service: sudo systemctl enable --now mariadb\nNextcloud needs some tables setup in order to store information in a database. First set up a secure sql database:\nsudo mysql_secure_installation Say “Yes” to the prompts and enter root password:\nSwitch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]: Y Change the root password? [Y/n]: Y\t# enter password. Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]: Y Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: Y Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: Y Sign in to your SQL database with the password you just chose:\nmysql -u root -p Create the database: While signed in with the mysql command, enter the commands below one at a time. Make sure to replace the username and password. But leave localhost as is:\nCREATE DATABASE nextcloud; GRANT ALL ON nextcloud.* TO '{username}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '{password}'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; EXIT; Nextcloud Install Clone the git repo into /var/www/nextcloud: git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/server.git /var/www/nextcloud \u0026\u0026 cd /var/www/nextcloud\nAdd an exception for git to access the directory:\ngit config --global --add safe.directory /var/www/nextcloud Initialize the git submodule that handles the subfolder “3rdpartysudo”:\ncd /var/www/nextcloud \u0026\u0026 sudo git submodule update --init Change the nextcloud folder ownership to apache and add permissions: sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/nextcloud sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/nextcloud\nSelinux:\nsudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t \"/var/www/nextcloud(/.*)?\" \u0026\u0026 \\ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t \"/var/www/nextcloud/(config|data|apps)(/.*)?\" \u0026\u0026 \\ sudo restorecon -Rv /var/www/nextcloud/ Now we can actually install Nextcloud. cd to the /var/www/nextcloud directory and run occ with these settings to install:\nsudo -u apache php occ maintenance:install \\ --database='mysql' --database-name='nextcloud' \\ --database-user='root' --database-pass='{password}' \\ --admin-user='admin' --admin-pass='{password}' Create a CNAME record for DNS. Before you go any further, you will need to have a domain name set up for your server. I use Cloudflare to manage my DNS records. You will want to make a CNAME record for your nextcloud subdomain.\nJust add “nextcloud” as the name and “yourwebsite.com” as the content. This will make it so “nextcloud.yourwebsite.com” is the site for your nextcloud dashboard. Also, make sure to select “DNS Only” under proxy status.\nHere’s what my CloudFlare domain setup looks with this blog as the main site, and cloud.perfectdarkmode.com as the nextcloud site:\nThen you need to update trusted domains in /var/www/nextcloud/config/config.php:\n'trusted_domains' =\u003e [ '{subdomain}.{domain}.com', 'localhost' ], Restart httpd systemctl restart httpd\nInstall SSL with Certbot Obtain an SSL certificate. (See my Obsidian site setup post for information about Certbot and Apache setup.)\nsudo certbot -d {subdomain}.{domain}.com Now log into nextcloud with your admin account using the DNS name you set earlier:\nI recommend setting up a normal user account instead of doing everything as “admin”. Just hit the “A” icon at the top right and go to “Accounts”. Then just select “New Account” and create a user account with whatever privileges you want.\nI may make a post about which Nextcloud apps I recommend and customize the setup a bit. Let me know if that’s something you’d like to see. That’s all for now.",

    "content": "Easy concepts to grasp, challenging to apply to the real world. This is how we communicate with other people. I have been trying some of the methods and mindset while I was reading this book. Sometimes the strategies of using empathy and getting to know the needs behind words and behaviors have helped resolve tensions but other times it falls flat on it’s face due to me being very mechanistic about the whole thing. This is going to need a re-read at some point.\nThere is clear direction in my mind about what other areas to study in order to get better at this:\nGetting better at Empathy Being in touch with your own needs and feelings Saying “No” without Feeling Guilty Negotiating without compromising (Identify and satisfy the needs of both sides) Summary and Highlights When we give from the heart, we do so out of the joy that springs forth whenever we willingly enrich another person’s life.\nThis kind of giving benefits both the giver and the receiver. The receiver enjoys the gift without worrying about the consequences that accompany gifts given out of fear, guilt, shame, or desire for gain.\nThe giver benefits from the enhanced self-esteem that results when we see our efforts contributing to someone’s well-being.\nFour components of NVC:\nobservations feelings needs requests Helps us connect with each other and ourselves in a way that allows our natural compassion to flourish.\nGuides us to reframe the way we express ourselves and listen to others by focusing our consciousness on four areas: what we are observing, feeling, and needing, and what we are requesting to enrich our lives.\nFosters deep listening, respect, and empathy and engenders a mutual desire to give from the heart.\nSome people use NVC to respond compassionately to themselves, some to create greater depth in their personal relationships, and still others to build effective relationships at work or in the political arena.\nMoralistic judgments that imply wrongness or badness on the part of people who don’t act in harmony with our values.\nFirst component of NVC entails the separation of observation from evaluation. When we combine observation with evaluation, others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying. NVC is a process language that discourages static generalizations. Instead, observations are to be made specific to time and context, for example, “Hank Smith has not scored a goal in twenty games,” rather than “Hank Smith is a poor soccer player.”\nA common confusion, generated by the English language, is our use of the word feel without actually expressing a feeling\nIn general, feelings are not being clearly expressed when the word feel is followed by:\nWords such as that, like, as if: “I feel that you should know better.” “I feel like a failure.” “I feel as if I’m living with a wall.” The pronouns I, you, he, she, they, it: “I feel I am constantly on call.” “I feel it is useless.” Names or nouns referring to people: “I feel Amy has been pretty responsible.” “I feel my boss is being manipulative.”\nExpressions of actual feelings: “I feel disappointed in myself as a guitar player.” “I feel impatient with myself as a guitar player.” “I feel frustrated with myself as a guitar player.”\nHow we are likely to feel when our needs are being met:\nabsorbed adventurous affectionate alert alive amazed amused animated appreciative ardent aroused astonished blissful breathless buoyant calm carefree cheerful comfortable complacent composed concerned confident contented cool curious dazzled delighted eager ebullient ecstatic effervescent elated enchanted encouraged energetic engrossed enlivened enthusiastic excited exhilarated expansive expectant exultant fascinated free friendly fulfilled glad gleeful glorious glowing good-humored grateful gratified happy helpful hopeful inquisitive inspired intense interested intrigued invigorated involved joyous, joyful jubilant keyed-up loving mellow merry mirthful moved optimistic overjoyed overwhelmed peaceful perky pleasant pleased proud quiet radiant rapturous refreshed relaxed relieved satisfied secure sensitive serene spellbound splendid stimulated surprised tender thankful thrilled touched tranquil trusting upbeat warm wide-awake wonderful zestful How we are likely to feel when our needs are not being met:\nafraid aggravated agitated alarmed aloof angry anguished annoyed anxious apathetic apprehensive aroused ashamed beat bewildered bitter blah blue bored brokenhearted chagrined cold concerned confused cool cross dejected depressed despairing despondent detached disaffected disappointed discouraged disenchanted disgruntled disgusted disheartened dismayed displeased disquieted distressed disturbed downcast downhearted dull edgy embarrassed embittered exasperated exhausted fatigued fearful fidgety forlorn frightened frustrated furious gloomy guilty harried heavy helpless hesitant horrible horrified hostile hot humdrum hurt impatient indifferent intense irate irked irritated jealous jittery keyed-up lazy leery lethargic listless lonely mad mean miserable mopey morose mournful nervous nettled numb overwhelmed panicky passive perplexed pessimistic puzzled rancorous reluctant repelled resentful restless sad scared sensitive shaky shocked skeptical sleepy sorrowful sorry spiritless startled surprised suspicious tepid terrified tired troubled uncomfortable unconcerned uneasy unglued unhappy unnerved unsteady upset uptight vexed weary wistful withdrawn woeful worried wretched We accept the other person’s judgment and blame ourselves. blame others. sense our own feelings and needs. sense others’ feelings and needs. Connect your feeling with your need: “I feel … because I need …”\nDevelopment toward a state of emotional liberation, most of us experience three stages in the way we relate to others.\nStage 1: In this stage, which I refer to as emotional slavery, we believe ourselves responsible for the feelings of others.\nWe think we must constantly strive to keep everyone happy. If they don’t appear happy, we feel responsible and compelled to do something about it. This can easily lead us to see the very people who are closest to us as burdens.\nStage 2: In this stage, we become aware of the high costs of assuming responsibility for others’ feelings and trying to accommodate them at our own expense. When we notice how much of our lives we’ve missed and how little we have responded to the call of our own soul, we may get angry.\nStage 3: At the third stage, emotional liberation, we respond to the needs of others out of compassion, never out of fear, guilt, or shame.\nUsing Positive Action Language Express what we are requesting rather than what we are not requesting.\nRequests may sound like demands when unaccompanied by the speaker’s feelings and needs.\nOur requests are received as demands when others believe they will be blamed or punished if they do not comply.\nWhen people hear a demand, they see only two options: submission or rebellion. Either way, the person requesting is perceived as coercive, and the listener’s capacity to respond compassionately to the request is diminished.\nThe more we have in the past blamed, punished, or “laid guilt trips” on others when they haven’t responded to our requests, the higher the likelihood that our requests will now be heard as demands.\nChoosing to request rather than demand.\nDoes not mean we give up when someone says no to our request.\nThe fourth component of NVC addresses the question of what we would like to request of each other to enrich each of our lives.\nTry to avoid vague, abstract, or ambiguous phrasing, and remember to use positive action language by stating what we are requesting rather than what we are not.\nEach time we speak, the clearer we are about what we want back, the more likely we are to get it. Since the message we send is not always the message that’s received, we need to learn how to find out if our message has been accurately heard.\nCommon behaviors that prevent us from being sufficiently present to connect empathically with others:\nAdvising: “I think you should … ” “How come you didn’t … ?” One-upping: “That’s nothing; wait’ll you hear what happened to me.” Educating: “This could turn into a very positive experience for you if you just … ” Consoling: “It wasn’t your fault; you did the best you could.” Story-telling: “That reminds me of the time … ” Shutting down: “Cheer up. Don’t feel so bad.” Sympathizing: “Oh, you poor thing … ” Interrogating: “When did this begin?” Explaining: “I would have called but … ” Correcting: “That’s not how it happened.”\nIntellectual understanding blocks empathy.\nAfter we focus our attention and hear what others are observing, feeling, and needing and what they are requesting to enrich their lives, we may wish to reflect back by paraphrasing what we have understood.\nOur tone communicates that we’re asking whether we have understood—not claiming that we have understood.\nBehind all those messages we’ve allowed ourselves to be intimidated by are just individuals with unmet needs appealing to us to contribute to their well-being.\nEmpathy is a respectful understanding of what others are experiencing. We often have a strong urge to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or feeling. Empathy, however, calls upon us to empty our mind and listen to others with our whole being.\nCarl Rogers - “When … someone really hears you without passing judgment on you, without trying to take responsibility for you, without trying to mold you, it feels damn good! … When I have been listened to and when I have been heard, I am able to reperceive my world in a new way and to go on. It is astonishing how elements that seem insoluble become soluble when someone listens, how confusions that seem irremediable turn into relatively clear flowing streams when one is heard.”\nConversations that are lifeless for the listener are equally so for the speaker.\nOur ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable, defuse potential violence, hear the word no without taking it as a rejection, revive a lifeless conversation, and even hear the feelings and needs expressed through silence.\nMourning in NVC The process of fully connecting with the unmet needs and the feelings that are generated when we have been less than perfect\nExperience of regret, but regret that helps us learn from what we have done without blaming or hating ourselves.\nMoralistic judgments we use when blaming ourselves tend to obscure such possibilities and to perpetuate a state of self-punishment.\nSelf-Forgiveness When I behaved in the way which I now regret, what need of mine was I trying to meet?\nDon’t Do Anything That Isn’t Play!\nAn important form of self-compassion is to make choices motivated purely by our desire to contribute to life rather than out of fear, guilt, shame, duty, or obligation.\nTranslating “Have to” to “Choose to”\nStep 1 List any activity you dread but do anyway because you perceive yourself to have no choice.\nStep 2 Acknowledge to yourself that you are doing these things because you choose to do them, not because you have to. Insert the words “I choose to … “ in front of each item you listed.\nStep 3 After having acknowledged that you choose to do a particular activity, get in touch with the intention behind your choice by completing the statement, I choose to … because I want ….\nWhen we do things solely in the spirit of enhancing life, we will find others appreciating us. Their appreciation, however, is only a feedback mechanism confirming that our efforts had the intended effect. The recognition that we have chosen to use our power to serve life and have done so successfully brings us the genuine joy of celebrating ourselves in a way that approval from others can never offer.\nWhen we speak a language that denies choice, we forfeit the life in ourselves for a robotlike mentality that disconnects us from our own core.\nAnger We are never angry because of what others say or do.\nAnger is a result of life-alienating thinking that is disconnected from needs. It indicates that we have moved up to our head to analyze and judge somebody rather than focus on which of our needs are not getting met.\nAnger can be valuable if we use it as an alarm clock to wake us up—to realize we have a need that isn’t being met and that we are thinking in a way that makes it unlikely to be met\nAll violence is the result of people tricking themselves, as did this young man, into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished.\nWhy would people want to tell the truth, knowing they will be judged and punished for doing so?\nThe more people hear blame and judgment, the more defensive and aggressive they become and the less they will care about our needs in the future\nFour Steps to Expressing Anger:\nStop and do nothing except to breathe. Identify the thoughts that are making us angry. Connect to the needs behind those thoughts Open our mouth and speak the anger—but the anger has been transformed into needs and need-connected feelings. The more we empathize with what leads them to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more likely it is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards.\nExercise: List the judgments that float most frequently in your head by using the cue, “I don’t like people who are … ” Collect all such negative judgments in your head and then ask yourself, “When I make that judgment of a person, what am I needing and not getting?”\nConflict Resolution and Mediation Creating a connection between the people who are in conflict is the most important thing.\nIt’s not until you have forged that connection that each side will seek to know exactly what the other side is feeling and needing. The parties also need to know from the start that the objective is not to get the other side to do what they want them to do. And once the two sides understand that, it becomes possible—sometimes even easy—to have a conversation about how to meet their needs.\nUse the word satisfaction instead of compromise!\nOur objective is to meet everyone’s needs fully.\nIf we had a clear statement of each person’s needs—what those parties need right now from each other—we will then discover what can be done to get everybody’s needs met.\nConflict Resolution Steps:\nExpress our own needs. Search for the real needs of the other person. Verify that we both accurately recognize the other person’s needs. Provide as much empathy as is required for us to mutually hear each other’s needs accurately. Propose strategies for resolving the conflict, framing them in positive action language. Needs contain no reference to anybody taking any particular action.\nStrategies, which may appear in the form of requests, desires, wants, and “solutions,” refer to specific actions that specific people may take.\nInstead of expressing needs, they were doing analysis, which is easily heard as criticism by a listener.\nWhen we reflect back incorrect guesses to others, it may help them get in touch with their true needs.\nHave the Needs Been Heard?\nWhen people are upset, they often need empathy before they can hear what is being said to them\nUsing Present and Positive Action Language to Resolve Conflict.\nAvoid moving hastily into strategies, as this may result in a compromise that lacks the deep quality of authentic resolution that is possible.\nIt is the presentation of strategies in clear, present, positive action language that moves conflicts toward resolution.\nPresent language statement refers to what is wanted at this moment.\n“Would you be willing to …”\nIn the absence of present language, a request such as “I’d like you to go to the show with me Saturday night” fails to convey what’s being asked of the listener at that moment.\n“Would you be willing to tell me whether you will go to the show with me Saturday night?,”\nSupports clarity and ongoing connection in the exchange. We can further clarify the request by indicating what we may want from the other person in the present moment, “Would you be willing to tell me how you feel about going to the show with me Saturday night?”\nUsing Action Verbs Focus on what we do want rather than what we do not want. Talking about what one doesn’t want can easily create confusion and resistance among conflicting parties.\nIt’s not unusual, if someone tells us they’d like us to listen when they are talking, for us to hear accusations and thus feel some resentment.\nA situation that is typical in conflicts when parties use vague words like “listen” to express strategies.\nUse of action verbs to capture something that we can see or hear happening—something that can be recorded with a video camera. “Listening” occurs inside a person’s head; another person cannot see whether it is happening or not. One way to determine that someone is actually listening is to have that person reflect back what had been said: we ask the person to take an action that we ourselves can see or hear. If the other party can tell us what was just said, we know that person heard and was indeed listening to us.\nMaintaining respect is a key element in successful conflict resolution.\nWhen they say “no,” they’re saying they have a need that keeps them from saying “yes” to what we are asking.\nKeep the Conversation in the Present\nIt is likely that we will hear a lot of discussion about what happened in the past and what people want to happen differently in the future. However, conflict resolution can only happen right now, so now is where we need to focus.\nUse role-play to speed up the mediation process.\nSometimes mediations get heated, with people shouting at or talking over one another. To keep the process on track under such circumstances, we need to get comfortable with interrupting.\nThe purpose of interrupting is to restore the process.\nWhen we witness behaviors that raise concern in us First thing we do is to empathize with the needs of the person who is behaving in the way we dislike.\nThe Protective Use of Force NVC requires us to differentiate between the protective and the punitive uses of force.\nThe intention behind the protective use of force is to prevent injury or injustice. The intention behind the punitive use of force is to cause individuals to suffer for their perceived misdeeds.\nPeople behave in ways injurious to themselves and others due to some form of ignorance. The corrective process is therefore one of education, not punishment.\nIgnorance includes: (1) a lack of awareness of the consequences of our actions. (2) an inability to see how our needs may be met without injury to others. (3) the belief that we have the right to punish or hurt others because they “deserve” it. (4) delusional thinking that involves, for example, hearing a voice that instructs us to kill someone.\nPunitive action, on the other hand, is based on the assumption that people commit offenses because they are bad or evil, and to correct the situation, they need to be made to repent. Their “correction” is undertaken through punitive action designed to make them: (1) suffer enough to see the error of their ways (2) repent (3) change\nIn practice, however, punitive action, rather than evoking repentance and learning, is just as likely to generate resentment and hostility and to reinforce resistance to the very behavior we are seeking.\nChildren’s fear of corporal punishment may obscure their awareness of the compassion that underlies parental demands.\nOther uses of force also qualify as punishment. One is the use of blame to discredit another person; for example, a parent may label a child as “wrong,” “selfish,” or “immature” when a child doesn’t behave in a certain way. Another form of punitive force is the withholding of some means of gratification, such as parents’ curtailing allowances or driving privileges. In this vein, the withdrawal of caring or respect is one of the most powerful threats of all.\nWhen we submit to doing something solely for the purpose of avoiding punishment, our attention is distracted from the value of the action itself.\nThe job gets done, but morale suffers.\nSooner or later, productivity will decrease.\nPunishment is costly in terms of goodwill. The more we are seen as agents of punishment, the harder it is for others to respond compassionately to our needs.\nTwo Questions That Reveal the Limitations of Punishment What do I want this person to do that’s different from what he or she is currently doing? What do I want this person’s reasons to be for doing what I’m asking?\nPunishment and reward interfere with people’s ability to do things motivated by the reasons we’d like them to have.\nNVC, however, fosters a level of moral development based on autonomy and interdependence, whereby we acknowledge responsibility for our own actions and are aware that our own well-being and that of others are one and the same.\nFreeing Ourselves From Old Programming Pain engendered by damaging cultural conditioning is such an integral part of our lives that we can no longer distinguish its presence.\nResolving Internal Conflicts\nErnest Becker attributes depression to “cognitively arrested alternatives.”\nWhen we have a judgmental dialogue going on within, we become alienated from what we are needing and cannot then act to meet those needs. Depression is indicative of a state of alienation from our own needs.\nExpressing Appreciation in Nonviolent Communication When we use NVC to express appreciation, it is purely to celebrate, not to get something in return.\nThree Components of Appreciation:\nActions that have contributed to our well-being Particular needs of ours that have been fulfilled Pleasureful feelings engendered by the fulfillment of those needs Saying “thank you” in NVC: “This is what you did; this is what I feel; this is the need of mine that was met.”\nReceive appreciation without feelings of superiority or false humility.\n“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.” - Marianne Williamson\nBe more aware of what others around me are doing that enriches my life, and to hone my skills in expressing this appreciation.\nSome Basic Needs We All Have Autonomy\nChoosing dreams/goals/values Choosing plans for fulfilling one’s dreams, goals, values Celebration\nCelebrating the creation of life and dreams fulfilled Celebrating losses: loved ones, dreams, etc. (mourning) Integrity\nAuthenticity Creativity Meaning Self-worth Interdependence\nAcceptance Appreciation Closeness Community Consideration Contribution to the enrichment of life Emotional Safety Empathy Honesty (the empowering honesty that enables us to learn from our limitations) Love Reassurance Respect Support Trust Understanding Physical Nurturance\nAir Food Movement, exercise Protection from life-threatening forms of life: viruses, bacteria, insects, predatory animals Rest Sexual Expression Shelter Touch Water Play Fun Laughter Spiritual Communion\nBeauty Harmony Inspiration Order Peace Books mentioned: How to Make Yourself Miserable, Dan Greenburg The Color Purple, Alice Walker Building a Peace System, Robert Irwin The Revolution in Psychiatry, Ernest Becker The Secret of Staying in Love, John Powell",

It was very helpful to go over some of these subnetting questions once in a while. Link.\nFlashcards Anki Deck These are the only flashcards I used. It is very nice not to have to create your own flashcards. Having the Anki app on your phone is very convenient. You can study whenever you have a few minutes of downtime.\nAnki also used spaced-repetition. It will give you harder flashcards more often based on how you rate their difficulty.\nThis particular deck goes along with the OCG. You can filter by chapter and add more as you get through the book.\nI will be using Anki flashcards for every exam in the future. Link.\nMy Top 3 Be careful not to use too many resources. You may get a bit overwhelmed. Especially if this is your first certification like it was for me. You will be building study habits and learning how to read questions correctly. So focus on quality over quantity.\nIf I had to study for the CCNA again, I would use these three resources:\nOCG Boson Exsim Anki Flashcards If you like these posts, please let me know so i can keep making more like them!",

    "content": "We are going to use Vagrant to set up two RHEL 8 servers with some custom configuration options. I will include some helpful Vagrant commands at the end if you get stuck.\nIn this guide, I will be using Fedora 38 as my main operating system. I use Fedora because it is similar in features to Red Hat Linux Distributions. This will give me even more practice for the RHCSA exam as I use it in day-to-day operations.\nNote, if you are using Windows, you will need to install ssh. This can be done by installing Git. Which automatically installs ssh for you.\nYou will also need to have the latest version of Virtualbox installed.\nHere are the steps: Download and install Vagrant Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in Add the vagrant box Install the Vagrant disk size plugin Initialize the Vagrant box and Edit the Vagrant file Bring up the Vagrant box 1. Download and install Vagrant. In Fedora, this is very easy. Run the following command to download and install Vagrant:\nsudo dnf install vagrant\n2. Make a new directory for your vagrant lab to live in. Make your vagrant directory and make it your current working directory:\ncd Vagrant Add the Vagrant box. vagrant box add generic/rhel8\nInstall the Vagrant disk size plugin. The disk size program will help us set up custom storage sizes. Since we will be re-partitioning storage, this is a useful feature.\nvagrant plugin install vagrant-disksize\nInitialize the Vagrant box and edit the Vagrant file. First, initialize the Vagrant box in the vagrant directory: vagrant init generic/rhel8\nAfter completion, there will now be a file called “Vagrantfile” in your current directory. Since Vim is on the RHCSA exam, it’s wise to practice with it whenever you can. So let’s open the file in Vim:\nvim Vagrantfile\nYou will see a bunch of lines commented out, and a few lines without comments. Go ahead and comment out everything and paste this at the end of the file:\nVagrant.configure(\"2\") do |config config.vm.box = \"generic/rhel8\" config.vm.define \"server1\" do |server1| server1.vm.hostname = \"server1.example.com\" server1.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.2.110\" config.disksize.size = '10GB' end config.vm.define \"server2\" do |server2| server2.vm.hostname = \"server2.example.com\" server2.vm.network \"private_network\", ip: \"192.168.2.120\" config.disksize.size = '16GB' end config.vm.provider \"virtualbox\" do |vb| vb.memory = \"2048\" end end| The configuration file is fairly self-explanatory. Save Vagrantfile and exit Vim. Then, create /etc/vbox/networks.conf and add the following:\n* 10.0.0.0/8 192.168.0.0/1 * 2001::/646 This will allow you to be more flexible with what network addresses can be used in VirtualBox.\nBring up the Vagrant box. Now, we bring up the Vagrant box. This will open two Virtual machines in Virtualbox named server1 and server2 in headless mode (there is no GUI).\nvagrant up\nGreat! Now we can use Vagrant to ssh into server1:\nvagrant ssh server 1\nFrom server1 ssh into server2 using its IP address:\n[vagrant@server1 ~]$ ssh 192.168.2.120\nNow you are in and ready to stir things up. The last thing you need is some commands to manage your Vagrant machines.\nHelpful Vagrant commands. Shut down Vagrant machines:\nvagrant halt Suspend or resume a machine:\nvagrant suspend vagrand resume Restart a virtual machine:\nvagrant reload\nDestroy a Vagrant machine:\nvagrant destroy [machine-name]\nShow running VMs:\nvagrant status\nList other Vagrant options:\nvagrant\nIf you are going for RHCSA, there is no doubt that you will also use Vagrant sometime in the future. And as you can see, it’s pretty quick and simple to get started.\nFeel free to reach out with questions.",

This mean the source code is available to all. And hosting yourself means you can guarantee that your data isn’t being shared.\nAs you can see. Nextcloud is feature packed and offers an all in one solution for many needs.

First set up a secure sql database:\nsudo mysql_secure_installation Say “Yes” to the prompts and enter root password:\nSwitch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n]: Y Change the root password? [Y/n]: Y\t# enter password. Remove anonymous users? [Y/n]: Y Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n]: Y Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n]: Y Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n]: Y Sign in to your SQL database with the password you just chose:\nmysql -u root -p Creating a database for NextCloud While signed in with the mysql command, enter the commands below one at a time. Make sure to replace the username and password. But leave localhost as is:\nCREATE DATABASE nextcloud; GRANT ALL ON nextcloud.* TO 'david'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '@Rfanext12!'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; EXIT; Install SSL with Certbot Obtain an SSL certificate. See my website setup post for information about Certbot and nginx setup.\ncertbot certonly --nginx -d nextcloud.example.com Create a CNAME record for DNS. You will need to have a domain name set up for your server. I use Cloudflare to manage my DNS records. You will want to make a CNAME record for your nextcloud subdomain.\nJust add “nextcloud” as the name and “yourwebsite.com” as the content. This will make it so “nextcloud.yourwebsite.com”. Make sure to select “DNS Only” under proxy status.\nNginx Setup Edit your sites-available config at /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud. See comments in the following text box:\nvim /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextcloud # Add this to the file: # replace example.org with your domain name # use the following vim command to make this easier # :%s/example.org/perfectdarkmode.com/g # ^ this will replace all instances of example.org with perfectdarkmode.com.

Here is a guide on troubleshooting with occ. The basic command is as follows:\nsudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ Add this as an alias in ~/.bashrc for ease of use.\nYou are ready to log in to Nextcloud! Go to your nextcloud domain in a browser. In my case, I head to nextcloud.perfectdarkmode.com. Fill out the form to create your first Nextcloud user:\nChoose an admin username and secure password. Leave Data folder as the default value. For Database user, enter the user you set for the SQL database. For Database password, enter the password you chose for the new user in MariaDB. For Database name, enter: nextcloud Leave “localhost” as “localhost”. Click Finish. Now that you are signed in. Here are a few things you can do to start you off:\nDownload the desktop and mobile app and sync all of your data. (covered below) Look at different apps to consolodate your programs all in one place. Put the Nextcloud dashboard as your default browser homepage and customize themes. Set up email integration. NextCloud desktop synchronization Install the desktop client (Fedora)\nSudo dnf install nextcloudclient Install on other distros: https://help.nextcloud.com/t/install-nextcloud-client-for-opensuse-arch-linux-fedora-ubuntu-based-android-ios/13657\nRun the nextcloud desktop app and sign in. Choose folders to sync. Folder will be ~/Nextcloud. Move everything into your nextcloud folder. This may break things with filepaths so beware. Now you are ready to use and explore nextcloud. Here is a video from TechHut to get you started down the NextCloud rabbit hole.\nChange max upload size (default is 500mg) /var/www/nextcloud/.user.ini php_value upload_max_filesize = 16G php_value post_max_size = 16G\nRemove file locks Put Nextcloud in maintenance mode: Edit config/config.php and change this line:\n'maintenance' =\u003e true,\nEmpty table oc_file_locks: Use tools such as phpmyadmin or connect directly to your database and run (the default table prefix is oc_, this prefix can be different or even empty):\nDELETE FROM oc_file_locks WHERE 1\ndisable maintenance mode (undo first step).

    "content": "This second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action.\nI have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I’ve got down the process.\nI highly advise you make your own outline so you do not have to read everything “twice again”.\nSummary and Highlights The barrier between the life you are living and the life you want is effective execution. Getting in shape is not a knowledge problem, it’s an execution problem. In order to maintain effective execution, you must:\nFocus on the things that matter Maintain a sense of urgency Get rid of low value activity Annual goals remove the sense of urgency we need to achieve our goals. 12 weeks is long enough to get things done, but short enough to not let you lose sight of your goals. Every 12 weeks you get a fresh start.\nIf you have had a bad 12 week year you can shake it off and start fresh. If you have had a good 12 week year, then you can build off the momentum.\nAt the end of each 12 week year, take a week of to reflect, regroup, and re-energize. You have 4 times as many opportunities to set new goals and celebrate your accomplishments.\nEach weeks counts. And each day counts as you increase your focus on a few important daily tasks. Focusing on the short term keeps you from getting ahead of yourself.\nYou need a strong emotional stake in your goals Action is uncomfortable, you must have values in place. You must value your higher purpose more than your comfort. If you establish a compelling vision of the future. And align your short term goals and plans with that vision. Then it will be easier to cope with short term discomforts.\nQuestions to ask when creating your vision: What do you truly want to achieve? What legacy do you want to create? What do you want for yourself and your family? What do you want spiritually? What level of security do you seek? What level of income and fulfillment do you want from your career? What interests do you wish you could pursue? What do you really want to do with the time you have been allotted? You create things mentally before you create them physically. And you will never outpace your mental models. Vision is where you engage your thinking about what is possible for you.\nPeople focus on only their career or business. But those are only certain aspects of life. You need to establish a vision of your whole life, and align your business goals around that.\nYou need to make your vision compelling enough to act on it. This is what creates the emotional connection needed to act on your goals.\nThis creates passion.\nThe execution system The eight fundamental elements can be broken down into 5 disciplines and 3 principles.\n5 Disciplines\nVision Planning Process Control Measurement Time use 3 Principles\nAccountability Commitment Greatness in the moment How to create a personal vision Find out what you want in all areas of life:\nSpiritual Relationships Family Income Lifestyle Health Community Your career or business vision is is more powerful when it is developed in light of your personal vision. Once you have a personal vision, you can figure exactly the amount of income or production you need from your career or business.\nBy thinking about your vision often, your strengthen the areas of the brain that would help you make that happen.\nShift from a “How?” mindset to a “What if?” mindset. This helps you see your vision as possible. Then to “How might I?” and determine a plan. This helps you see your vision as probable.\nNext, Implement your plan. This moves your vision from probable to Given.\nThree time horizons for your vision Long term aspirations Mid-term (3 years) 12 weeks Long term aspirations Imagine and embrace all possibilities. What do you want to have, do, and be in your life? What is most important to you in each life category? How much free time? What level of income?\nWhat is your vision 5, 10, and 15 years into the future?\nMid-term (3 years) What do you want to create over the next 3 years based on your long term vision?\nAsk yourself these questions Why are these things important to you? What does your vision unlock for you? What will be different for you, and those around you, if you reach that goal? Who will you share your vision with? How often have you looked at your vision? What risks or barriers might get in the way?\nTeam or family vision Have each member work through their personal visions. Then come together and make a group vision that aligns with everyone’s personal visions.\nDo this Take your vision seriously. Keep it in front of you and align your plans with it. Review it often. Think BIG. Your vision should challenge you. Share your vision with others, print it out, review it daily. Find ways to make it more meaningful and vivid. Reflect on each day. Was it filled with activity that moved you toward your vision? What action will you take tomorrow? The 12 week year A vision without a plan is just a dream. Working from a plan helps you focus on the right things, saves you time, and reduces mistakes. You make your mistakes when writing your plan down on paper. A plan helps you cut through unimportant distractions that pop up every day.\nQuarterly goals are typically smaller goals that help you get to your annual goals. 12 week years are shrinking your annual goals into 12 weeks. Each 12 weeks stands alone.\n12 weeks is a more predictable time frame. The farther the goal, the more unpredictable. Which makes it harder and harder to plan for. it’s nearly impossible to predict what your actions should be 12 months into the future.\n12 weeks narrows your focus and keeps you from spreading yourself too thin. 12 weeks also gives you structure.\n1. Set goals Identify your 1-3 goals for the 12 weeks. This goals are the next 1-3 steps toward your long term vision. Then, create the tactics, or the daily or weekly actions you need to take to reach those goals.\nConsistent action on few critical tasks is what drives success. Like dropping water wearing away on a stone.\nSpend 20 minutes at the beginning of each week to review your previous week and plan the new one. Spend the first 5 minutes of each day reviewing your weekly plan and setting your plan for the day accordingly.\nCheck in with this plan multiple times per day and make sure you are executing on it. A good goal is specific and measurable, positively stated, realistic, and time bound.\nAsk yourself why this goal is important to you? What will be different if your achieve this goal?\nIs this in line with your vision?\n2. Create a plan Set the actions needed, and when they are to be acted on, as daily or weekly tasks. Brainstorm on a sheet of paper all of the things you need to do to or ideas to achieve your goal.\nWhat actions will you struggle with? What can you do to overcome those struggles? Select the smallest number of the brainstormed actions needed to achieve the goal.\nTrying to execute too many tactics will spread you thin.\nKeep it simple.\n3. Set up Process controls Process controls are what you do to keep your plan from breaking down in a lapse of willpower. The two elements of process control are a weekly plan, and peer support.\nA weekly plan gives you clarity. Not all is lost when you lose 50% of a week.\nPeer support creates room for getting help from others. Meet on a weekly basis to discuss progress, struggles, and challenges. Encourage one another. Form a group of 2-4 committed people.\nWeekly meeting agenda:\nIndividual report Results to date Weekly execution score Intentions for the coming week Feedback and suggestions from the group Discuss what has been working and how to incorporate that into each other’s plan Encouragement Weekly plan Take 15 minutes at the beginning of each week to plan the week on paper. Make sure you include all of your tasks for the week. Do not assume each week will be the same. And do not (usually) add extra tactics that weren’t in the original plan. Use this plan to guide your day.\nOnly change your plan if you have been executing and it’s not working.\nWeekly Score Measuring your success will tell you if what you are doing it working. And lets you know what adjustments to make. The data you get from measuring does not care about efforts or intentions. Only on outcomes. Are you getting the outcome you desire?\nThe sooner you confront yout outcomes, the sooner you can figure out what works and what doesn’t. Then you can shift your focus to what is working.\nMeasure lead and lag indicators.\nLag indicators measure overall results such as lbs lost, money made, etc. Lead indicators measure the activities that produce the results. Are you following through with your plan?\nYou can always control results, but you can control execution in real time. So Lead indicators should be your primary focus.\nIf you are not hitting your goals, is it a problem with the plan? Or with the execution of that plan? Is your strategy flawed? Or are you failing to implement that strategy? Once you identify your problem, you can address it head on.\nEstablish a set of lead and lag indicators for each of your goals. And measure your lead indicators as a percentage of tactics completed. (measuring execution, not results.) Score yourself on the percentage of tactics completed that week.\nStrive for excellence, not perfection. Aim for 85% and you will most likely achieve your objectives. Even 65-70% is better than nothing.\nFacing the reality of your actions is hard. You will be uncomfortable if you are not doing the things you need to do. (Productive tension)\nUse this as a catalyst for change, instead of running away.\nTeam/Family Process Control Does everyone have a plan for each week? Are they scoring each week? Are they participating in a weekly group meeting?\n4. Use your time with purpose Say no to things that go against your goals. Organize your life around your priorities that make progress toward your vision. Be intentional about how you allocate your time.\nT.V. may be beneficial in some ways, but helping us live a life of significance is not one of them.\nYou may be doing busy work that is actually unimportant to the goals at hand.\nAlign your time and energy with what you do best and what you enjoy doing.\n5. Performance time Blocking out time chunks to work on important tasks. There are three categories of performance time:\nStrategic blocks Buffer blocks Breakout blocks Strategic blocks 3 hour block of time scheduled early into each week. Block out every distractions and work on core tasks. Reschedule if this gets interrupted. Time to work on your business not in it. Focus on one thing at a time. NO DISTRACTIONS!\nConnect with your vision 12 week review Assess performance breakdowns Work on tactics Buffer blocks For unplanned and low value activities lie checking email, phone calls, organizing, etc. 1-2 30 minute buffer blocks per day.\nBreakout blocks Taking time away from work. 3 hours long and spent on things other than your business. Used to refresh and reinvigorate your mind. Helps prevent burnout and create free time.\n6. Creating a routine Create an ideal week calendar where your schedule your performance time and organize critical tasks so that you will be most productive. Consider when you tend to be at your best. And schedule important tasks around those times.\n7. Taking ownership Own your results regardless of circumstances. Tap into your resources and give it your best. Own the things you can control (Your thinking and actions). Be willing to confront the truth about your situation.\nLearn from failures and do not place blame.\nRemove the victim mindset. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.\nBe willing to take new and improved actions. And surround yourself with people who also take ownership.\nClarify expectations. Learn from life and focus on the future. Acknowledge reality.\nFocus on the things that you can control.\n8. 12 week commitments Commitments are not broken when things get hard. Commitment fosters trust, confidence, and improves results. You are bound emotionally to a course of action.\nWhen you are interested in something it can be abandoned. When you are committed, you are bound to results. You make no excuses.\nKeys to successful commitments You have a strong desire that is meaningful. You identify the one or two core actions that will give you the result. You identify the costs associated with keeping the commitment. You act on the commitments rather than on your feelings. 12 week commitments are easier that 12 months ones. With a true commitment, don’t give yourself an out. Even if you fail. You gave it your all.\nDon’t give up if you break a commitment once. And confront missed commitments.\nValue your word.\nDon’t over commit by taking on more than you can handle. Go public with your commitments and find a buddy.\nGreatness happens in the moment Your daily actions decide your greatness long before the results ever show up. The daily difference between mediocrity and greatness is slim. But the difference down the road is tremendous.\nIntentional imbalance Like balance is where you are purposeful about where your spend your time and efforts. It is not about spending equal time in all areas of life. You identify the most important areas of your life to work on, and set your 12 week goals to make progress in those areas.\nThen, re evaluate the areas of yourlife that need work for the next 12 weeks. Rate the areas of your life out of 10. (Spiritual, Relationships, Family, Income, Lifestyle, Health, Community)\nThen Work on the lowest ones.\nThe emotional cycle of change 5 stages people move through emotionally when changing their behavior\nUninformed Optimism We imagine all of the benefits but have not experienced the costs. Informed Pessimism You begin to experience the costs and wonder if they are worth the end goal. Valley of despair When most people give up. All of the pain of change is felt and the benefits seem far away or unimportant. Informed Optimism New actions are becoming routine and you start to feel the benefits. Success and fulfillment Cost of change are gone, benefits are fully realized Every time you complete this cycle, your capacity and confidence increase. Awareness of this cycle is important to help you manage negative emotions.\nAuthor book recommendations:\nSwitch by Chip and Dan Heath The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg Feel the Fear and do it anyway by Susan Jeffers If you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback. I want to become a better writer and help others grow along with me. Feedback is invaluable for this goal.\nThanks for reading!",

Filled with practical tips on identifying your audience, email strategy, branding, marketing, things to watch out for, etc. Definitely read this if you are wanting to start a blog.\nSummary and Highlights Have a business model.\nHave core core or brand that is responsible for attracting people to you.\nTwo approaches to a new blog: content first or offer first.\nWith content first, you start with no product or service and create content to attract, grow, and nurture your audience. Your blog serves as a content hub to get people in the door.\nYou get permission to be in touch with them via email.\nYou find out what type of content makes your audience tick.\nOnce you start attracting an audience, you promote your own digital or affiliate products or offer the services that are most aligned with their needs and your skill set or expertise.\nIn Method 2, you have existing products and services and your blog serves to support your business\nEven if you start with Method 1—like I did—you will eventually need to transition to Method 2\nYou need to figure out\n• The types of problems you want to solve for your audience.\nYour Business Model (Your pathway to making money.

But it also means that there is validation\nof an existing audience out there for your blog…\nThat there is demand for the information, products, and services related to that niche\nThat there are people who are actively looking to solve pain points or need support in this niche\nThose big blogs may take a chunk of your audience, but not everyone will resonate with the voice and style of the big blogs. That’s the reason several blogs are able to thrive alongside each other.

This could be via digital products, coaching, services, events, or even physical products\nYour niche does not target a one \u0026 done\nproblem\nYour niche needs to have recurring income potential.

Your blog is a transient medium\nEmail is the only thing that gives you this undivided attention.\nYou think you need it only after building an audience but without it, it’s hard to nurture an audience as well. And even if you have a product ready for sale now, you wouldn’t be able\nto sell it because you don’t have a pool of subscribers to sell it to.\nYour primary content channel is to attract an audience, build trust, and entice them to sign up for your email\nlist\nWhat separates you from everyone else?\nHow is your content different? How is your business going to be different?\nYou don’t want to fit in. When you blend in too much with everyone else in your niche, you make it hard for readers to choose you.\nthis “the hook”—a simple pivot or deviation from something familiar meant to get your audience’s\nattention.\nbook The One Hour Content Plan\nthink about why someone should read your blog over the thousands of others on a similar subject matter?\nsix\nways to differentiate your business. Have a look at the diagram below.\nsaying it in a way that nobody else has before via your brand voice, style, or presentation\nAre you able to solve\nyour audience’s pain point in a better way than anyone else?\nEverything you do is centered around helping your audience tackle one specific challenge\ngiving your audience access to you is seen as a bad thing. But this is how you can\ndistinguish yourself\nGood service is a point of parity; it’s what you’re expected to have. So if this is your differentiator, your service has to be truly exceptional\nEvery brand has a spot in the marketplace. While low price does not necessarily equate to low quality, especially when you target the right audience, you don’t want to pick this as a differentiator. Because this often leads to a race\nthe bottom\nOnce you pick a point of differentiation, ask yourself the following:\nIs it relevant to your readers?\nWhat words do they use to describe your content and doing business with you? Is this aligned with how you want to differentiate yourself? Is that differentiation evident to your readers?\nYour differentiation strategy may need to change with time so always analyze the space and see that your differentiation strategy still holds true.\nDon’t fall for the most popular or\npromoted tool or service\nFree or cheapest is not always the best\nwhat you can expect to pay for in the early\nA premium mobile-optimized theme\n• Good hosting\n• An email service provider\n• Lead capture tools (landing pages \u0026 opt-in forms)\nAs you charge more for your products, you may want to create a better experience for your students\nAs you start to attract more people, maybe you want to outsource design rather than do it yourself.\nCan I make back this investment? Does this investment allow me to save time to (a) serve my audience better and (b) engage in business-building activities that would allow me to increase my income?\nThink of your content in terms of buckets. Each content category is a bucket and you can have 3–5 content buckets.\nthink about the content your target persona wants and needs. What does she want to know from you? What subjects do you have enough knowledge or experience in, that matter to her?\nIf I wanted to be known for just three topics, what would those be?”\nYour readers start to get a clear picture of what you are about and who you serve.\n• You’re seen as “an expert” or knowledgeable in a few topics rather than anything and everything.\nIt’s easier to work with brands because they’ll look at your main topics to see if they fit with their products.\n• It’s easier to secure clients\nThese will shift over time\nit’s easier to establish authority in 1–3 topics\nbank or vault to capture ideas in.\nwhere exactly are you going to get ideas from?\nLOOK AT YOUR OWN NICHE AND COMPETITION\nWhat articles have done well for them in terms of shares and comments?\nHow can you replicate this success?\nSign up for content curation sites. These are\nsites like\n- ContentGems\n- Scoop.it\n- BuzzSumo\nThese sites will send you lists of articles on topics you have selected in your notification\nsettings. These sources will give you the fuel to ensure your content bank is always filled.\nOnly attempt to replicate those topics if there is a gap that you can fill.\nThere are three characteristics of content that are deemed valuable\nFills an opportunity gap\nCould your content be better? Will your piece make a contribution to the existing content on this topic? Could you make it more helpful or\nuser-friendly with tutorials or videos? Can it go further in-depth?\n2. Has a clearly identifiable point of view\nIs there a viewpoint or angle that hasn’t been addressed in the existing content out there?\nDoes your content take a stance about the topics and\nproblems in your niche that others have not? Could your personality or brand voice give it a different slant?\n3. Breaks sacred cows\nAre there**** myths and beliefs that are immune from criticism or question? Does your content prove\nthese wrong?\nMETHOD 2: DO MORE OF WHAT’S WORKING FOR YOU\nMake sure you have Google Analytics installed for this step.\nIf you don’t have Google Analytics yet, get the free plug-in Google Analytics Dashboard for WP. This plug-in automatically adds the tracking code to all the pages on your site.\nThen go to Google Analytics and sign up for a free account.\nLook at your Google Analytics account to find your\nstrong/strong\u003e\n• Top Posts\nGo to Behavior \u003e Site Content \u003e All Pages.\nLook at your top ten posts.\n• Bounce rate\nGo to Behavior \u003e Site Content \u003e Landing Pages.\nLook for posts with a low bounce rate.

Identify the posts with the higher click-through rates.\nMETHOD 3: CREATE CONTENT FOR ALL LEVELS OF YOUR READERS\nEveryone who comes to your site is at a different place in the journey.\nSome may be aware of the problem your service or product solves. Some be actively shopping for a solution. Others may be at the very beginning and have no idea that they even have a problem to\nsolve in the first place.\nDepending on the stage your reader is at, they require different pieces of content to move them from one stage to another.\nTo effectively move your readers from one stage to another, answer the following question:\nWhat keeps my audience stuck in this phase and what do they need from me and my content to move forward?\nCreate different pieces of content to fuel the\nreader journey\nbooks The One Hour Content Plan and The Profitable Content System.\nYoast defines cornerstone content as the core of\nyour website. “It consists of the best, most important articles on your site; the pages or posts you want to rank highest in the search engines.”14\nideal topic for a cornerstone content piece is something that people are commonly searching for, without\ngetting satisfying results.”15\nThe content pieces that you want to tackle are those that\n• Raise your brand awareness\n• Establish authority and trust\n• Feed your funnel (helping you build an email list\nfor example)\nMinimum Viable Content Plan (MVCP). These\nTwo how-to or list posts on a pressing question the competition has failed to address.\n(Authority post showcasing your expertise\nOne polarizing or opinion post; e.g., X things you should never believe about…Why this is flawed\nWhat they don’t ever tell you about…\n(Authority post showcasing your expertise)\nNote: This post can quickly come across as a rant if you don’t have the credibility or authority to show for it yet. That doesn’t mean you have to shy away from writing opinionated posts\njust means that you need to show examples and substantiate your content with third-party sources such as reputable articles and quotes from authoritative sources.\nHOW TO OUTLINE YOUR POSTS\n1. DETERMINE THE PURPOSE OF THE POST\nAlways determine how each piece of content is going to fit into your entire blog and business. Ask yourself what’s the goal of the post.\nWhat do you want each post to do?\nWhen you write with the end in mind, you know what you want the post to do for you. You measure what that post is meant to do based on the tangible and intangible goals you set beforehand.\nA tangible goal\n• Drive opt-ins to gauge interest for a product.\n• Get opt-ins and then lead them down a sequence to a paid product.\n• Make an affiliate commission.\n• Pitch a sponsored post.\nEducate your reader (how-tos\nAn intangible goal\n• Position yourself as an expert or thought leader.\n• Network with influencers (through a roundup post).\n• Empower your readers (e.g., motivational\npieces, income reports).\n• Entertain with personal stories.\nThe goal of your content needs to center on action.\nIDENTIFY THE MAIN PAIN POINT\nPain always triumphs benefit. So always lead with the pain your audience is facing.\nWhat pain point are you hitting at in the post? Knowing this will help you with writing the introduction and conclusion of your posts. It will also make it easy for your audience to identify\nwith and relate to your post\nat least once a week or once every two weeks.\ngrow your email list while your blog\nis still a work in progress. This is what I refer to as Minimum Viable Email Marketing (MVEM).\nYour MVEM consists of the following:\n• One opt-in incentive or lead magnet\n• One landing page for your main opt-in incentive\nor lead magnet\n• Opt-in forms on three top posts\nCheck your Google Analytics to find out what these are. Head to Behavior \u003e Site Content \u003e All Pages.\nOne thank you page where you will direct new\nsubscribers to click confirm that they do indeed want to subscribe to get your opt-in incentive\nOne top bar/exit intent pop-up/slide-in to capture traffic\n• One welcome email that covers the 3Cs\n- Credibility\nWho are you? Why should they trust you or listen to you?

Is there an opt-in incentive that’s converting\nwell for you?\nIf yes, create an accompanying product to that opt-in incentive. Have a look at this diagram.\nYour first product has to sit right after the opt-in that you created. All email content that you’re creating should nudge the people who opted in toward that product or service.\nAre you known for a particular topic or do people come to you asking questions about a\nparticular topic?\nIs there a certain category of posts that gets you the most amount of traffic?\nGo back to the earlier question I asked: what do you want to be known for?\nDo you want to be a part of the conversation in a particular space?\nBefore you create a single worksheet or slide deck for your product, do some validation.\nYou need to find out if there is a need for this product in the market or in your niche.\nOne question I always get is…\nshould I run surveys and ask my audience what they want?\nDo your audience really know what they want?\nNo, they don’t.\nThis is why I don’t recommend running surveys\nOne of Henry Ford’s famous quotes was “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”\nInstead of forcing your audience to discuss solutions that they don’t yet appreciate or fully\nrecognize, get them to discuss problems or symptoms they have\nhow then can you test the viability of a product? How do you know if this is something people will buy\nLook at the market. A market consists of a group of products with similar characteristics\nScan the market for the existence of other similar offers. This shows you that there's a need—that people are looking for ways to solve this problem\nHow searched for is the problem that your offer solves?\ntool I’m loving right now is Keywords Everywhere\nAre there popular articles on BuzzSumo?\nAre there existing courses on Udemy or courses\ncreated by other players in your niche?\na few things to look out for when you’re doing your market research:\n• Hook\nLook for the hook that other product creators\nhave used\nYour hook is the promise of the product. In many cases, the hook is a mixture of promise + timeline.\nWhat exactly are they helping students achieve and how do they promise to help them achieve that?\nTestimonials\n– What are students saying? You want to look for gaps in the market for what people want and have not received and how you can fill in with your product.\n• Benefits\nFeatures\n• Bonuses\n• Results\n• Price point\nif you can’t answer why someone\nshould buy your product over someone else’s, then no one can.\nOnce you have certain ideas for the type of product you want to create and you’ve validated them, write targeted blog posts that show your expertise on the topic. You want your readers to\nassociate you with the topic of the product\nestablish your authority and expertise in it so that readers trust your views and teachings with regard to that topic.\nDon’t wait to monetize your site\nif you’re spending more time than you’re comfortable with, if you’re expending more energy than is worth what you’re getting back, that’s a revenue stream you should consider getting rid of.\nMarketing isn’t just about selling or promotion. It’s also about attracting and capturing your ideal customers.\nmarketing is made up of these four\nactivities: Attract – Capture – Engage – Convert\nsix parts:\n• Identify your target audience.\n• Attract them to your site.\n• Capture your target audience.\nNurture that target audience.\n• Convert them to buyers.\n• Turn them into brand advocates or repeat customers.\nWhen there are gaps in your marketing system\ngaps in any one of these six areas—your business\nwill often experience feast and famine cycles\nHave a look at the table below\nStranger They haven’t heard of you before at all.

    "content": "This book is a no BS guide to dog training without being a jerk. Any dog can be training with progressive reinforcement techniques. The author even explains why aversive training not only doesn’t work, but it makes problems sprout up in other areas of your dogs life.\nLoaded with how-to’s on all of the basic things you should treat your dogs and dealing with common problems.\nSummary and Highlights All living things repeat behaviors that are rewarding and avoid behaviors that are not.\nYou don’t need to punish dog to make behavior not rewarding. Instead, figure out how to make the right behavior rewarding enough.\nReward behaviors you want. Ignore or prevent behaviors that you don’t want.\nTeach him the English words for those behaviors and make them very rewarding and fun. Dogs can only learn one behavior for any particular cue. Agree on which cues will be used for which behaviors and be consistent.\nThink in terms of what you want your dog to do, not what you want him not to do. Prevent your dog from being rewarded for behaviors that you don’t want. Reward consistently and generously for behaviors that you do want.\nTraining Cues Oops: The behavior you are doing will not earn you a reward, no reward marker, use sparingly.\nRelax: Lie flat on your side.\nSit: From whatever position you are in\nStand: Stand still on all four legs.\nStay: Don’t move from the position I left you in until I release you.\nTake: Take food or object into your mouth (beginning of teaching dog to retrieve).\nTouch: Touch your nose to designated target.\nWait: Pause, stop moving until I leave or release you.\nNegative reinforcement (bad) Dog’s behavior makes a bad thing go away.\nOperant conditioning Subject can manipulate it’s environment by his behavior. Choosing behaviors that are either rewarded or punished\nPositive punishment (bad) The dog’s behavior makes something undesirable happen, and a behavior decreases as a result. Can cause aggression and fear. Does not provide dog enough information to act.\nPositive reinforcement Dog’s behavior makes something desirable happen. As a result, behavior is likely to increase.\nNegative punishment The dog’s behavior makes something desirable go away and the behavior is likely to decrease as a result. (Turn and walk away)\nNegative reinforcement The dog’s behavior makes something undesirable go away. The behavior is likely to increase.\nBenefits of positive reinforcement Get dogs to voluntarily offer behaviors we want without force. Can phase out use of food as reward when behavior is solid enough. A dog is NEVER 100% reliable.\nNegative attention is still attention\nInstead of physically punishing, ignore dog by not making eye contact, not speaking to him, and turning your back on him until he does something good like sits, then reward with treats and attention.\nYou have to intervene when behavior is dangerous until they are better trained.\nIf they find something more rewarding then they will not answer you.\nReward with petting, praise, playing with a toy, making eye contact, opening the door, or throwing the ball.\nWrite down vocab list and post on the fridge for everyone to use.\nThey don’t know between right and wrong\nDogs are masters at reading body language\nWhen your dog makes a mistake, instead of saying “No, bad dog!” Say “oops” then show her the right way to do it.\nBody Language Be consistent with your body movements.\nDogs can learn to tolerate or love threatening behavior.\nTeach kids not to hug dogs they do not know and not to stare in their eyes.\nTeach your dog to love having his collar grabbed.\nTeach your dog to love eye contact.\nMove away rather than towards your dog if you want them to come.\nDogs see as a threat:\nEye contact Loud, firm, angry vocalizations Reaching over head (Grab collar under the chin for safety) Primate hovering Body Blocking Taking up space to prevent your dog from doing so.\nOnce you get good at it you can simply lean forward with your intent to occupy the space.\nNot good for dogs the resource guard\nCalming Signals Deference behaviors help keep the peace in a pack (canines are better described as deference hierarchies rather than dominance hierarchies)\nModerate behaviors in each of these categories are safer than extreme versions of these behaviors on either side.\nAppeasement (active submission) Increased activity and diminished posture.\nWants attention\nNuzzling (use negative punishment to stop) Licking (negative punishment or install incompatible behavior approach with toy) Jumping up (negative punishment or install incompatible behavior sit or down) Pawing motions (put on cue or replace with incompatible behavior four on floor) Smiling Teeth clacking (ignore or put on cue) Crouching (ignore or reinforce dog approaching taller) Pretzeling (put on cue) Play-bows (put on cue) Excitement urination Ears pulled back Tail wagging Deference (passive submission) Decreased activity and lowered body posture.\nWants attention to go away\nEars pressed flat against head Tail tucked Freezing Avoiding eye contact Urination Lowered body posture or belly up Displacement Behaviors performed in an effort to resolve an internal stress conflict.\nBlinking Chattering teeth Nose licking Scratching Shaking off when not wet Yawning Drooling/ foaming Excessive grooming Hyperactivity Immune system disorders Lack of focus Leaning/clinging Lips pulled back Lowered body posture Mouthing Obsessive compulsive disorders Panting Hair raised on back of neck Stiff movement Stretching Sweaty paws Trembling Whining Stress signs Anorexia Appeasement/ deference signals Avoidance Brow ridges Digestive disturbances Threat (dominance) displays Children do not recognize threat signals.\nBarking Freezing Growling Hard stare Lips pulled forward Nose bumping Snapping Snarling Training Equipment Motivators, reward markers, collars, and leashes\nMotivators (rewards) Food Lower value treats at home.\nDinner kibble Train before meal.\nHigher value reward in more distracting environment.\nHot dog Frozen liver Life Rewards Use when dog has learned a trick well\nToys Play Petting Praise Chase ball Walk Car ride Play with dog pals Reward Markers Every time you click or say yes the dog should get a treat.\nClick is always food treat.\nVerbal can be treat or life reward.\nBehaviors are marked the instant they happen (at least within one second).\nClicker Used to immediately signal to the dog he has done something good.\nTrain new behaviors with an actual clicker. You can use a badge reel to keep it on you.\nVerbal marker One syllable word such as “Yes!” Uttered once per reward.\nCollars If dog slips collar: Limited-slip collar (martingale or greyhound collar)\nHarness Can encourage dog to pull. But can also be used to put pulling on cue.\nEasy walking Harness Easy-walk Sense-ation Sense-ible K9 freedom harness No: Choke chains Prong collars Leashes 6 foot leash No roll up leashes Management tools Used for preventing unwanted behaviors before they happen.\nCrates Never a place for punishment Give lots of treats in crate Put on cue Toss treats in crate when you aren’t training Feed meals in crate with the door open Reward for being quiet in crate after fushing Tethers 3–6 ft plastic coated cable Used to keep dog in a spot when teaching manners Should be set up with a soft bed and chew toys Should be pleasant Baby Gates To keep dog out of restricted areas. Exercise Pen When they have to be left alone all day. Train them to love the pen before you leave. Head Halter Negative reinforcement. Can suppress behavior making training challenging. Behaviors Offered Behaviors Capturing When a dog offers the complete, perfected behavior that you are trying to train all on their own, the behavior is captured.\nShaping Break down trick into small steps. Click and reward at each step.\nElicited Behaviors Imitation Dogs are more likely to imitate other dogs than humans. Click and treat desired behaviors.\nLuring Using treat or target object to show them how to do the behaviors. This is good to use in combo with shaping.\nShould be faded away soon as possible, replace the lure with body language.\nModeling Physically assisting the dog into position.\nLeast desirable and effective method. Should be gentle and faded away quickly\nManagement Use a tether or crate to keep them away until you can train them otherwise.\nPositive Punishment Use positive punishment sparingly (dogs behavior makes bad things happen).\nShould work within one or two applications.\nNo Physical harm such as:\nShock collars Hanging Helicoptering Hitting Use NO! for life threatening situations only.\nBetter to use negative punishment (dogs behavior makes good thing go away) to change an unwelcome behavior.\nBasic Training Truly reliable recall (90% or better) in the face of serious distraction can take years to master.\nHave fun, don’t be too serious.\nIndoors for new tricks is better than outdoors.\nPractice in different environments after they know the behavior.\nMay need to back up a few steps in a new environment.\nGroup training classes can give them a good distracting environment to train.\nFind dozens of opportunities to let them know the trick happens everywhere.\nWill be able to learn new behaviors in distracting environments eventually.\nSix Steps for teaching a new behavior Get the behavior by capturing, shaping, or luring. Mark the behavior (click or verbal) Reward the behavior (Treat or life reward) Repeat the behavior until it happens easily at least 80% of the time. Add a verbal cue just before the dog does the behavior Use verbal cue to elicit behavior (After you say the word before the trick half a dozen to 2 dozen times) How often to train Several 5–15 minute sessions each day (30–45 minutes per day).\nTraining session:\nPick one or two tricks to focus on. Start with something they are good at to get them tuned into you. If either one or both of you start getting frustrated it’s time for a break End session on a positive note by having them do a trick they love. Jackpot! For extraordinary efforts. Click and say in an excited tone “Jackpot!” and give extra rewards.\nThe Clicker Click must happen the instant the dog is does or is doing the behavior you want to reinforce. Offering the treat is a separate step.\nClick and pause — then offer the treat (a second or two).\nEventually the time between click and treat can be lengthened.\nNo Reward Marker Tells dog they have not earned a reward for their behavior.\nOops!\nUse sparingly, if at all.\nKeep it positive.\nLeash Not a handle or a steering wheel.\nRestricts access to environmental rewards.\nCan stand on it or tie it to your belt.\nMust be loose (6 inch valley) unless restricting access to environmental reward.\nWeek 1: Core Exercises Charging the Clicker Muffle sound at first, click and treat several times \u003e unmuffle, click and treat several times.\nDo a couple dozen reps.\nDon’t click if they are doing a naughty behavior.\nCan use tape to muffle if needed then gradually peel back layers of tape over time.\nThe name game Say your dogs name, if he looks at you “click” and reward. Don’t say name more than once if he doesn’t look at you.\nMake a kissy noise and click and reward if they look at you. You can say name and click and treat even if they are already looking at you.\nFamily play version Get everyone with clickers in a circle and take turns saying his name and clicking and treating.\nAttention without name version Put leash on in low distraction environment. Any time he looks at you click and reward. Gradually increase the length of time between clicks.\nYou can add a “watch me” cue when he keeps his attention focused for several seconds.\nAfter he keeps attention for ten seconds or more, add distractions increasing in difficulty.\nThe goal is to get them to offer attention during training sessions.\nSit/ Down Don’t give treat while sitting, lure or shape.\nSay good boy when he sits\nPuppy Push Ups Teach sit from down position. Click for each up and down. Eventually can wait a few ups and downs between clicks.\nVary the amount so they never know how much they have to do.\nStand By Me Get them to stand near you. Let them nibble at treat to get them to stand longer.\nUse body movement to get the behavior.\nSpin and Twirl Spin is one way twirl is the other. Use shaping and lures.\nWeek 2 Come (recall) Never punish dog for coming to you. Stay positive, do not use intimidation, punishment or anger.\nSay in happy upbeat tone and make sure good things always happen when the dog arrives.\nIf you leave the dog park when she comes you are punishing her.\nBounce a ball or squeek a toy. Run away and get her to chase you Or gently grab her collar.\nTry come with all family members round robin style.\nGradually add distractions indoors — cat crossing the room, bouncing a ball, knock on the door, etc.\nCome and sit is better than come and jump up.\nIf they do not come outdoors, attach a 30 foot Nylon cord to make them easier to retrieve. Grab cord and use come then reward. Don’t drag.\nTouch Touch or target — teaching dog to touch a target with nose on cue. Can use if they don’t respond to come.\nUseful to teaching dog to ring bell, close doors, go bowling, play soccer, turn on the tv, agility obstacles, etc.\nTarget can replace food as a lure. Start using hand as target cause dog likes to sniff hands. Move hand around after they get it at nose level. Then you can teach it to a different target object.\nCan use as a tool for cueing behaviors that you can’t reach with your hand.\nHold treat and clicker behind back if it is distracting. Can drop treats on the ground or keep treats in a bowl on a nearby shelf\nNo Jumping Zone Whole family has to agree not to reward her for jumping up.\nTeach them to sit for attention. Wait for your dog to sit without being asked.\nOn-leash jump with strangers Have stranger approach with treat at chest height, click when dog sits then treat.\nIf dog jumps up for treat have the stranger pull treat away and cheerfully say “oops!”.\nRepeat with many people.\nThe On-Leash Jump with You Attach tether to stable object. Approach dog from ten feet away. Only approach while dog is sitting, stop when dog jumps up.\nYou aren’t asking for them to sit, you want them to offer sit on their own. Then you can click when you reach dog and they are still sitting.\nTry backing up a step when they get up.\nOff-Leash Jump As you walk in the front door, turn away and step away if dog jumps. Once they sit, click, treat, and pet. If they start to jump up again, turn and step away.\nBehavior Chain A series of behaviors that get chained together because dog thinks reward is dependent on all of the behaviors not just the last one.\nThey might learn chain behavior of jump up, sit, reward.\nCure: look for times they sit without jumping up.\nDon’t ignore your dog when they are doing good.\nAsking for an incompatible Behavior Say sit or down before they have a chance to jump up and click reward. This only works if they immediately respond to the replacement command.\nIf you have to repeat the cue several times with Rambo jumping up on you then you are rewarding them with attention for jumping and teaching them to ignore your commands.\nLet’s Walk When you tolerate pulling, your dog learns that pulling gets them where they want to go. If you want to get fancy, you can teach your dog different cues for walking in different positions.\nFor now, think of walks as training games rather than to get to a destination or exercise.\nKeep sessions short at first.\nDrive them to off leash play areas or other destinations until they get good at walking. And practice after they have burned off some excess energy.\nHang out and walk around for a bit, every time your dog is walking near you, click and treat.\nUse verbal “let’s walk” cue once they get the hang of it.\nGradually increase distractions\nTurn back on them if they get crazy.\nCan use oops cue.\nPick back up if they sit calmly.\nTake thrill out of they leash by picking it up randomly throughout the day.\nFor outside bring megasupply of treats and clicker.\nStand and wait if they hit the end of their leash.\nClick anytime the leash is loose.\nChange directions for more loose leash opportunities.\nDo not jerk the leash.\nDo not let them get environmental rewards for pulling.\nLet them earn environmental rewards with Cue “go sniff!”\nCan use touch command to show them what to do.\nUse front-clip no-pull harness for dog that drags.\nIf they pull back on treat shape them forward with clicks.\nDon’t let them get rewarded for stopping.\nUse high value treat for outdoors save that treat for only outdoors.\nRemember to back up a few steps if you get derailed.\nSit on a bench for an hour with treats to desensitize them to being outdoors.\nShake Try shaping, luring, or molding.\nLefty/Righty Add left and right verbal cue for each paw.\nHigh Five Click any touch of their paw to your palm and shape more vigorous responses.\nWave Hand signal — palm up and wiggle your fingers.\nGet them frustrated with no click until they jerk their hand higher, click and reward.\nTether Time out Use tether if dog is out of control.\nOnly use leash as tether if dog won’t chew on it.\nWatch them while tethered so they don’t learn chew on tether.\nPut comfortable rug or bed and chew toys at tether spots.\nWhen they get out of control say “too bad Luke, time out” and a few minutes on tether.\nCan pre-tether if you know they are going to flip out in a certain situation to prevent it from happening.\nIgnore barking or whining.\nOnly release when calm and quiet so they don’t learn that fussing gets them released.\nMust release them when they settle so they know that being calm earns freedom.\nYou can do another timeout right after if they rev up again.\nThis is a cheerful interlude, not a forceful punishment.\nWeek 3 Wait “Pause for a moment or two- don’t follow me”\nReminder for your dog to defer to you\nTeach manners by letting you go through doors first.\nCan use to pause them from chasing your cat.\nCan use to keep them from going to far ahead on off leash walks.\nLet him offer a sit at the door then say “wait”.\nCan use palm facing him wait signal.\nGradually open the door and clicking and treating each increment.\nIf he gets up, say “oops!” and have him sit again.\nLetting them out the door or playing in the yard can be a life reward for this.\nTry this on front door, car, outside, etc.\nMove back steps in the process if you lose progress.\nTake It! Almost as easy as charging the clicker.\nSay take it with a treat in your hand, click when the they take the treat.\nRepeat several times.\nHold treat different places (between your legs, get creative)\nTry with a toy, get him excited about it and say cue when you know he is going to take it.\nIt’s okay if they drop it after you give them treat. Hold is a later trick.\nWhen he is easily taking the toy from your hand try throwing it on the floor when you say take it, click and treat when he picks it up.\nGradually increase distance that you toss the toy (racing across the yard to take a toy).\nKeep take sessions short. Stop before they get tired or bored.\nVary the item you ask them to take.\nStart delaying the click for holds.\nPractice when they are full of energy and want to play if they will only take treats.\nTry high value toys (that have treats in or on them).\nLeave it! “Whatever you are looking at, I want you to leave it alone”\nHide high value treat under your foot or hand, click when they leave it alone.\nIncrease the time they have to be turned away and the click.\nClick and treat several times for staying away from the forbidden object.\nHide the object if they go for it again.\nWhen you move far from treat be prepared to dive an body block.\nRing Bell You can use touch to roll a ball, close a door, turn on a tv, ring bell to let you know he has to go out.\nAttach a bell to a string.\nHold bell in hand and ask dog to touch.\nAfter a few reps add verbal cue to ring it.\nHold bell so they will touch it even if they are aiming for your hand.\nMove hand further and further up the string and away from the bell.\nStart moving the bell around to have him ring in different locations.\nCan shape them to touch bell harder by only clicking harder and harder touches.\nCondition to ring bell to go outside.\nCan treat for potty if you only want him to use bell for potty.\nSit pretty Often called sit up or beg.\nStart with dog sitting and facing you.\nHold treat over nose so they have to stretch their head up to sniff it.\nClick and reward as paws come up high and higher.\nAdd verbal cue after the full sit up.\nAdd cue then lure the sit up and fade away the lure.\nCan put this on a raise the index finger cue.\nJumping Use “hugs” or similar cue.\nOnly gets reward if he is invited to jump up so he doesn’t get rewards for jumping uninvited.\nWeek 4 Go to Your Spot Place to send them to take a break from their undying devotion.\nPlace they go at dinner time.\nCan bring to have them settle at a public place.\nCan use doorbell as cue to go lay down in spot.\n“go to spot and lie down”\nUse shaping and click when they move toward spot.\nShaping will help her learn how to learn herself.\nCan help by looking at the spot they will look where you look.\nHide clicker and treats.\nCan also lure by saying “place” and learning them to their spot.\nAfter they get it start asking for a down at the spot in place of sit.\nAsk them to wait so they don’t jump up as soon as they get there.\nReward occasionally for just lying on the spot.\nGradually move farther and farther from place.\nCan bait the rug by putting treats on it.\nRelax Relax position for several seconds or more.\nCan use tummy rub or massage as life reward.\nLure or shape.\nStay “Stay in the position I left you until I tell you to get up”\nThree Elements to stay:\nDuration — How long dog stays.\nDistraction — Realiability.\nDistance — Distance you can move away from dog.\nWork on duration and distraction first.\nDo not ask for too much too soon.\nAsk them to sit for one second, click and treat and be calm so they don’t jump up.\nUse release word to encourage dog to get up.\nDon’t click the release cause you are training the stay behavior.\nStarts adding several seconds then the “stay” cue.\nSlowy increase seconds in stay.\nClick and reward during the stay several times.\nKeep reminding them with more “stay” cues.\nRelease before dog decides to move on their own.\nWisk treat behind back if dog gets up (negative punishment).\nProcess for “down” stay is the same.\nGradually fade the treat away from in front of them.\nAfter they stay for 10–20 seconds add distractions.\nStep to side click release, jump on one foot click release!\nTaking it gradually is the key here.\nThen add distance.\nTeach them that stay is never over until you return to them.\nAt higher levels you can call from stay 1 out of 10 times.\nAfter distance is mastered start combining the 3 elements.\nAlways return before they leave stay position.\nReturn to easier version if they start making mistakes.\nGive. Great for getting stuff out of puppy mouths.\nStart with toy in puppies mouth.\nSay give and hold out treat in hand, when she drops toy to ground click but hold treat until you pick up toy. Let her nibble on treat while you do this. Toss the toy again for life reward as well.\nPractice this with forbidden objects (accidently drop on near her so you don’t encourage playing with it).\nTry not to grab objects from the dog, instead play the give game.\nDo not do this for resource guarders.\nWeave Try touching the weave between the legs in a staggered stance.\nCan also lure.\nScore! Target a large ball by asking her to touch.\nBall needs to be too large to fit in their mouth.\nBring ball lowere and lower to ground and switch cue to score.\nShape harder and harder touches on ball so that the ball starts moving.\nSet up goal after they are pushing the ball a good distance.\nShape the score by only clicking when the ball goes through the goal.\nCan use toddlers legs spread as a v as a goal and they can pass back and forth.\nCan set up plastic bowling pins and use the same technique.\nPray Ask them to sit up (sitting pretty) and encourage them to rest their feet on a chair.\nShape this if they aren’t getting it.\nLure their nose down between their legs and click and treat.\nAdd cue.\nFade gestures away.\nWeek 5 Swing Moves dog to your side facing the same direction as you.\nGets your dog out of your way and into an approximate heel position, allowing you to walk forward together.\nCan put each side on a different cue.\nMove your dog to your left side.\nStart with dog sitting in front of you facing you close enough so you can pat them on the head.\nClicker in your left and and treats in your right.\nTake a long step straight back with your left foot.\nLure dog to your left and back with a treat.\nTurn dog toward you with the lure and bring them up along your left side.\nThen lift treat over their head to gett them to sit.\nCan use verbal sit cue if needed.\nAdd verbal cue after they are doing it easily.\nPut the treat where you want his nose to be.\nCan shape increasingly better sits.\nLeave It — Temptation Alley Learn how to leave it when you go on walks.\nSet up mildly interesting treats outside ten feet apart in an area where you can see them.\nWalk dog 5–10 minutes before you start to settle them a little.\nApproach the first pile. The instant the set their eyes on it say “leave it!” In a happy voice and stop moving.\nDo not jerk them back but do restrain so they can’t eat the goodies (prevention is key).\nThen wait, do not repeat the leave it cue and don’t pull him back. When they look away from the pile click and give a high value treat.\nThen go to the next pile and repeat.\nDo this until they can look awy from each pile with the verbal cue without a leash.\nChange this up by putting piles in different places, different location, with better treats and toys etc.\nTry off leash when they are responding 80% of the time.\nTake a step back if they oopsie and eat the pile.\nUp and Over Jump on and over objects.\nLay broomstick on the ground and have them walk over it.\nSay “over!” On an excited voice as they walk over it.

Put the toy away for at least 10 minutes.\nCan use “Yes!” Instead of clicker because your hands may be full.\nTrade for a treat if they don’t give up the rope.\nCan use the game itself as a reward.\nWeek 6 Excuse me Hold treat toward nose and let them nibble at it.\nMove the treat toward their chest and take a step toward her.\nClick after they take just one step back.\nShape as they do more and more steps back.\nDo this slowly.\nShould be doing 4–6 steps back before you add the cue.\nShape for straighter and straighter steps.\nIf they just sit then move the treat lower between their legs and click they instant they move their foot back.\nLong Distance Down Get your dog to drop on a dime at a distance.\nAsking them to do less to get them to stop chasing or doing something.\nTether dog or have a friend hold their leash.\nStand in front of dog facing them (they should be at the end of their leash facing toward you).\nTake a step back and give them a happy down cue.\nWhen dog lies down, click and step forward and treat.\nRepeat several times.\nVary the command when you step back so they don’t think that stepping back means down.\nGradually add more steps until they respond to cue across the room.\nStart adding distractions (reduce distance when you do this).\nIncrease distance with distractions.\nTry without a tether with reduced distance and distraction.\nStart asking for down when dog is in motion then in motion with distractions.\nDropped Leave It You drop and item and have them leave it.\nReward them for leaving it.\nReward when they look away from dropped item.\nStart dropping in less protected places than right next to you.\nThen say leave after the treat hits the floor.\nBe prepared to body block.\nHave someone drop something while you are walking with dog towards them.\nCross Paws Have dog lay down and tell them good boy.\nLure by moving treat left to right and shape the paw moving over.\nAdd verbal cue.\nSneak (Crawl on your belly like a reptile) Fade lure after they are crawling longer distances.\nBravo (bow) Start by luring them down and clicking for bent elbows bent then raise the treat back up before dog goes all the way down.\nCan try slipping hand or box under them so they do not go all the way down.\n“Bow” sounds too much like “down”.\nClick and Jackpot! Visualize the behavior you want your dog to do. Have a clear picture in your mind of the behavior you’re trying to achieve with your dog. Figure out how to prevent your dog from being rewarded for the behavior you don’t want. Reward him consistently and generously for the behavior you do want. The poisoned Cue Habituation occurs when your dog learns to ignore an environmental stimulus — a sound.\nSometimes sensitization occurs instead. Rather than habituating to a sound such as the doorbell, a dog may become more and more reactive each time the stimulus occurs. Thunder sensitivity is a perfect example of this.\nLearned irrelevance is similar to habituation. It applies to a dog who has learned to ignore a specific cue, rather than become accustomed to a startling stimulus. This is not deliberate willfulness on the dog’s part, but rather her lack of response to a cue that has failed to have consistent and sufficiently strong significance attached to it. The cue becomes meaningless if it doesn’t have a consequence.\n“poisoned cue.” A cue becomes poisoned when it sometimes has a negative consequence instead of a positive one.\nit will be easier for you to train her to come with a new cue than to try to make the association consistently positive.\nI have heard owners and trainers use words such as close, let’s go, and here in place of a poisoned Come.\nOnce you’ve trained a new Come cue, you have to remember not to poison that one too. If you have to do something to your dog that she’s not fond of, do something wonderful when she gets to you, and a few minutes later end the fun and do the not-so-nice thing.\nOr go get her instead of calling her to you. Meanwhile, make it a point to change her association with the things she doesn’t like. Teach her that a hand moving toward her collar makes yummy treats happen.\nTeach her that a hand moving toward her paw makes yummy treats happen. Then touching her paw. Then holding her paw. Then touching her paw with nail clippers. This process of counterconditioning and desensitization — changing the association with a stimulus — can be applied in countless training and behavior modification situations.\nIt works best when done gradually with numerous repetitions at each step, and not moving on until the dog is obviously happy about the process at each step.\nThe fewer things a dog must do in her world (or have done to her) that she doesn’t like, the less likely you are to poison her Come cue!\nSALIENCE When we say something is salient to a dog, we mean it has noticeable significance to her. Your dog learns to sit even in the face of distractions because the hotdog you are holding in front of her face is very salient.\nThe salient stimuli in the environment — you, your hotdogs, and the Sit cue — are more significant than the distractions. They overshadow the dog barking across the street, the skateboarder whizzing by on the road, the slamming of a car door down the block. If your dog is too distracted to respond to the Sit cue, then the distractions are more salient than you and your hotdogs.\nYou either need to move your training to a less distracting environment, or find a way to make you, your treats, and your cues more significant to your dog.\nBLOCKING when the use of a known cue overrides the dog’s ability to learn a new cue for the same behavior. Keep in mind that while dogs can only learn one response to a particular cue (sit must always mean “sit,” it can’t sometimes mean lie down), they can learn several cues that all mean the same behavior.\nI introduce the verbal cue and explain that any new cue being taught must always precede the known cue.\nI use a demo dog to show them that the dog doesn’t initially understand or respond to the word down until we associate it with the luring motion that means “down” to the dog.\nThe motion is salient to the dog — the word is not. I explain to my students that in order for the dog to hear the word and learn that it also has significance, they must say the word first, then lure the dog down.\nIf they give the verbal cue at the same time or after they lure, the lure blocks the dog’s ability to learn the new cue. With enough repetitions of the sequence — verbal cue, followed by lure (and click! and treat when the dog performs the behavior) — the dog will learn that the verbal cue also has salience, and you will no longer need to lure her down — she will lie down when you give her the verbal cue.\nFADING THE LURE One of the biggest complaints you’ll hear about positive training is that you always have to have food in your hand to get your dog to do what you ask. This is true only if you don’t make the effort to fade your lures — that is, to get your dog to respond to your cues when there’s no treat in sight. If you don’t fade lures fairly early in your training program, you and your dog can both become dependent on the presence of food to get behaviors to happen. The good news is it’s easy to fade lures; you just have to remember to follow the steps to do it. Let’s take Down as our example:\nLure the behavior: Move your treat toward the floor, clicking your dog for following, giving a nibble of treat with each click! Add the cue: When she lures down easily every time, say the Down cue each time just before you lure her down. Repeat a half-dozen times. Remember to click! and treat each time. Pause before luring: Now say “Down!” and pause. Wait for several seconds, then lure her down. Click! Treat. By following the word with the lure, you are translating, telling her that the word down means exactly the same thing as moving the treat toward the floor. Repeat several times. Add a little body language: As you say “Down!” or immediately thereafter, bend forward just a tiny bit from the waist. Since you probably bend forward when you lure, this little body language hint might jump-start your dog’s brain into moving down. If not, wait a few seconds and then lure. Watch for clues: Sometimes your dog will make small movements that tell you she’s starting to make the connection between the cue and the behavior. When you give the Down cue, she may look at the floor or lower her shoulders a little bit and then look at you as if to say, “Is this right? Is this what you mean?” If you catch these clues with a click! and quickly lure her the rest of the way, you’ve answered her question and she’ll probably understand and respond to the cue more quickly. EXTINCTION Extinction means taking a behavior that has been reinforced and making it go away by removing all reinforcement.\nYou can deliberately extinguish an unwelcome behavior by taking away any reinforcement your dog might be getting for it. We extinguish the behavior of jumping up by making sure no one pets, talks to, or looks at the dog when she jumps, and by stepping away so she doesn’t even have the pleasure of making contact with her paws.\nYou can also accidentally extinguish a desired behavior by forgetting to reinforce it or by not reinforcing it enough. Reinforcement isn’t always treats — it’s anything your dog likes: toys, play, eye contact, praise, pets, runs . . .\nWhen you use extinction to make a behavior go away, be aware that there is often an extinction burst — the behavior gets worse before it gets better because the dog is trying really hard to get reinforcement for a behavior that paid off in the past.\nYou want to be sure not to reinforce the dog during an extinction burst, or you’ve just taught her that trying harder gets reinforced. Don’t give in (unless the dog is in danger of injuring herself); comfort yourself with the knowledge that the extinction burst usually means you’re close to success.\nspontaneous recovery. Days, weeks, or even months after you extinguished a behavior, it suddenly rears its ugly head again.\nCircumstances occurred to refire the same old neuron pathway. The good news is, assuming you make sure the behavior isn’t reinforced, it should go away again quickly, and much more easily than the first time.\nPremack You can use a more rewarding behavior as the reinforcer for a less rewarding behavior, thereby improving the performance of the lesser behavior.\nFor example, if your dog would rather chase a bunny than come when you call her, you can use the Premack principle to teach her that she will get to chase a bunny — sometimes — if she comes to you first.\nYou start by using Premack indoors in a controlled environment to teach her how it works, and when she’s doing well there, move her outside. Leave your dog on a sit/stay and walk across the room. Your helper, with a plate of tasty treats, stands halfway between you and your dog, slightly off to one side. Your helper should also have a bowl to cover the treats when your dog tries to eat them. Now call your dog. If she stops to investigate the plate of treats, the helper covers the plate and doesn’t let her have a taste.\nYou keep calling your dog cheerfully and enthusiastically. When she finally comes to you, gently grasp her collar, say “Good girl!” then release her collar and say “Go get it!” Race with your dog back to the treats, now uncovered, and let her have a couple of bites.\nThen cover the plate and try it again. Eventually — sometimes surprisingly quickly — she will realize that she gets the treats sooner if she comes to you first and she will fly past the uncovered plate as fast as she can. This principle is also sometimes called Grandma’s Law, expressed as “You have to eat your vegetables before you can eat your dessert.”\nThere are a couple of drawbacks to using Premack in real life: (1) If the vegetables are too unpalatable, dessert may also lose its appeal; and (2) you can’t control the bunnies.\nGeneralization How do you help your dog learn to generalize operant behaviors? By doing exactly what your trainer probably told you to do — practice with her in as many different places as possible.\nCHAINING AND BACKCHAINING The behaviors are linked together so that each behavior is the signal for the next behavior in the chain, and the opportunity to perform the next behavior becomes the reinforcer for the previous one.\nBackchaining begins with the last behavior in the chain. Each step is added in reverse order, until the dog is performing the complete behavior. The theory is that when you teach the last thing first, your dog is always moving toward what she knows best, so she gains confidence as she learns the new links in the chain. The theory works.\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY Unless there is evidence to the contrary, you must account for a phenomenon with the simplest explanation available.\nHouse Training Think in terms of what you want him to do.\nHousetraining, an ounce of prevention is worth many pounds of cure.\nWill start using the phrase Do It when he starts to eliminate. This will teach him to go to the bathroom on cue.\nSocial Misfits As they get older (8 to 16 weeks), they are given careful exposure to other stimuli — visits to the vet hospital and groomer; walks in town; rides on elevators and escalators; sounds of cars, motorcycles, and skateboards; people of different ages, sexes, and ethnic backgrounds; people who dress, talk, and move in strange ways; and people with umbrellas, crutches, wheelchairs, and facial hair. The more positive exposures a dog has to a wide variety of experiences during this period, the more confident and well adjusted she will be throughout her life, and the more easily she will accept new experiences, even without prior exposure.\nSteps to take to foster courage in an unsocialized canine:\nTeach your dog a reward marker. Reward-mark his entire meal. If the dog is extremely unsocialized — fearful even of you — let this be the only way she gets to eat: by being in your company and, eventually when she’s brave enough, by eating out of your hand. She needs to learn that you are the source of all good things. Reward-marking won’t work well for a free-roaming feral dog — she will have access to other food sources and won’t have to tolerate your presence to find food. Reward-mark her for calm behavior around others. Make a list of her fear triggers. Use counterconditioning and desensitization. Desensitization is the process of gradually acclimating the dog to the things she is afraid of. Counterconditioning means replacing her involuntary undesirable reaction — fear — with a more desirable one that is incompatible with fear, such as the eager anticipation of a tasty treat. Reward-mark while others feed treats. Teach her to target. Caution: Avoid Coddling!\nBe Happy Healthy dogs chew. They also bark, dig, and run around. These behaviors are natural and necessary for them.\nteach him to go to the bathroom at appropriate appropriate times, in appropriate places. You will be far more successful in dealing with the challenges of chewing, digging, and barking if you address these natural behaviors the same way.\nCHOOSE YOUR CHEWS Stuffed Kong toys, marrow bones, and other indestructible but inviting chew objects are better choices than items that resemble our valued human possessions. Discarded socks and old tennis shoes teach a pup to head for the closet floor and the laundry basket when the chewing urge is strong.\nCarrots, apples, and other hard raw fruits and vegetables are also ideal puppy chews.\nGoodie Ship stuffed with liver treats.\nChewing is also a good stress reliever, which is why dogs who are anxious about being left alone at home often become destructive.\nPuppies should gradually be conditioned to being left alone so they can overcome their very strong and natural instinct to always be in the company of their pack. Providing your dog with a desirable and appropriate chew object prior to your calm departure can often help prevent separation anxiety from becoming a problem.\nSafety First Dogs have been known to choke on rawhide, which can get soft and slimy when chewed.\nRope toys can shred, and if swallowed, the pieces of string can become entangled in a dog’s intestines — a life-threatening situation. Plastic eyes, noses, and squeakers from plush toys also pose a hazard to your dog’s well-being.\nThe black rubber Kong toys are among the toughest\nOldies but Goodies You can regularly give your dog chicken and turkey wings and necks. Note: These are fed raw, not cooked, as part of a complete diet plan.\nThe Whole Dog Journal is a good resource for information on feeding a natural, healthy diet, as are books by Dr. Ian Billinghurst.\nPunishing Jaws after you take a forbidden object away from him does no good — he is likely to think that the last thing he did (giving up the object) is what he’s being punished for. Jaws can learn very quickly that chewing on an item of high value to humans is a good thing to do because it will initiate a rousing game of chase the puppy. If you punish him after you catch him, you won’t teach him not to play the game; you’ll just teach him to run faster next time! Don’t let him suck you into his game — use management and supervision to interrupt and redirect him before he is doing doughnuts around the dining room table with your $150 running shoe in his mouth.\nDigging Dogs who are most likely to engage in inappropriate digging are those who are left to their own devices in the backyard for long periods.\nMy philosophy of dog-human relationships, they belong anyway. Dogs are companion animals, and they serve that function best when they share our homes (dens) with us. Dogs who are exiled to a pen or to the backyard are often excruciatingly bored and/or lonely, which gives rise to a long list of behavior problems, including barking, digging, escaping, hyperactivity, poor socialization, and aggression.\nIf you want, you can even encourage your dog to dig — in the right place. Just as you teach your dog when and where it’s okay to go to the bathroom, you can teach Dozer when and where it’s okay for him to dig.\nYou can build a wooden digging box frame — spacious enough to accommodate Dozer’s size with room to spare — and set it where you want him to dig. Dig up the dirt within the framed area so it is soft and inviting.\nIf your dirt is hard clay, add sand and potting soil to break up the soil and keep it soft. Now invite Dozer to dig in his box by burying a toy or bone just beneath the surface of the soil. Get excited and tell Dozer to go dig.\nThen help him dig up the toy. Repeat this game often, until he will run to his box and start digging from anywhere in the yard when you tell him to go dig.\nYou can bury toys and bones in the box when he’s not looking so that he never knows what he’ll find in there.\nIf you do see him starting to dig where he shouldn’t, say “Oops! Go dig!” to interrupt and invite him back to the box. If he doesn’t have lots of unsupervised time to reward himself for digging in the wrong places, he will eventually confine his digging to his box.\nAn additional benefit to teaching him the Go Dig cue is that you can use it anytime you are in a place where digging is allowed — like the beach, where digging in the sand is great fun for dogs and humans alike.\nYou can also make use of his talents when you need a hole dug — to plant a tree, put in fence posts, or perhaps bury a treasure.\nBarking Simply slapping a no-bark electric shock collar (shudder) around the backyard dog’s neck may stop the barking, but it does nothing to help the dog become less bored, lonely, or frustrated.\nMy answer to the dog owner who asks how to get a dog to stop barking in the backyard day and night is simply to bring him indoors. This relieves his loneliness because:\nHe is now more a part of the family It does away with boredom because there are more interesting things going on inside the house It shuts out the stimuli that frustrate him — like squirrels in the trees and cats on the fence It lifts the burden from his shoulders of feeling like he’s the only member of the pack who is guarding the den We just want to be able to turn the barking off when we want. You can do this with a positive interrupt, or you can get more inventive and teach Woofie to bark on cue in order to teach him to stop barking on cue.\nTo use the positive interrupt, begin by teaching Woofie that over here means “Turn toward me for a click! and a treat.” Practice this on-leash with a small distraction, like sniffing a bush, until Woofie looks to you eagerly when he hears the Over Here cue.\n“Over Here!” As soon as he stops barking and turns toward you for his treat, click! and tell him “Quiet. Good boy!” then click! again for the quiet and give him another treat. (I actually have my clients say “Thank you!” to their dogs when we do this, to remind them that we really do appreciate having our dogs alert us to unusual visitors and events.)\nWhatever it is that gets Woofie to bark — walking up the sidewalk, knocking on the door, opening the door, or whatever. The more you repeat it, the less excited\nWoofie will be about the knock on the door and the quicker he will be to turn toward you on the Over Here cue. Of course, the next time someone comes to the door, Woofie will be excited all over again — it takes time and numerous repetitions of this exercise to get Woofie to give up his deeply ingrained, out-of-control barking behavior.\nRemember that you are not using the Quiet cue to make your dog stop barking — you are waiting until he stops barking and then telling him that the behavior of not barking is called quiet.\nIn time, when Woofie has learned to associate the word with the behavior of being quiet, you will be able to get him to stop barking with the Quiet cue, but if you use it in the beginning while he’s barking, you will be teaching him that quiet actually means “bark.”\nIn fact, I honestly believe that a lot of dogs think their owners are barking with them when they are actually yelling at them to shut up! I avoid teaching dogs to bark on cue if they don’t already bark a lot, but for those who are problem barkers, it can be a superb solution to the barking behavior challenge.\nGetting the bark on cue is the easy part — barky dogs are usually more than willing to offer the behavior.\nYou probably already know what stimulates Woofie to bark. If it’s a knock on the door, then knock on the door, click! when he barks, and feed him a treat.\nIf this works, do it again, but say “Speak!” or “Who’s there?” just before you knock. When he barks, click! and treat. Because he likes to bark anyway, in very short order he will probably bark for you on just the verbal cue, without the knock.\nAside from using this exercise to teach Woofie to be quiet on cue, it can also be useful for self-protection. I had one client who taught her dog that What Do You Want? was the cue to start barking.\nShe could then use it if she felt threatened by an approaching stranger, and her very friendly dog would bark nonstop and quite convincingly keep the potential bad guy at a distance.\nNow that you have the bark on cue, you can teach Quiet or Enough by clicking and rewarding a pause in the barking.\nAgain, remember that in the beginning you won’t be asking Woofie to stop barking with the verbal cue; you’ll just be associating the quiet word with the cessation of barking.\nEventually, when you know he has made the connection between the word and the behavior, you will be able to use the cue to ask him to stop barking.\nRemember first to thank him for alerting you to something going on in the world.\nYou never know when he might be trying to tell you that there’s a burglar outside, that Timmy has fallen into the well, or that your horses are running down your driveway.\nSeparation Anxiety Separation anxiety (SA), the canine equivalent of a panic disorder.\nA less intense stress response in dogs over being left alone is called isolation distress (ID).\nSpend fifteen to twenty minutes in a hard play session every morning to take the edge off Shep’s energy level before you leave the house.\nProvide as much exercise as possible at other times of the day as well. A dog who has a reservoir of pent-up energy is more stressed than one who is tired. A tired dog is usually a happier and better-behaved dog.\nBe calm when you leave and return. Dramatic good-byes and hellos raise Shep’s anxiety level.\nGive Shep a Kong toy or marrow bone filled with peanut butter or cheese just before you leave.\nDo not crate Shep unless you know she stays calm in the crate while you are gone.\nBiting All dogs can bite. And under the right set of circumstances, the gentlest, most loving dog can be induced to bite.\nAggression is caused by stress. Each thing (stimulus) that causes a dog stress is a small building block (stressor) toward that dog’s bite threshold.\nA dozen or more commonly recognized classifications of aggression, including status-related aggression, fear-related aggression, maternal aggression (a mom protecting her puppies), play aggression (when a dog’s level of arousal escalates during play and turns into aggression), displaced aggression, pain aggression, territorial aggression, possession aggression, protection aggression, barrier aggression, and redirected aggression.\nResource Guarding You can build on this foundation by working with Gimme at her mealtimes in a four-week resource-guarding program. Begin by setting her dish on the counter and putting her kibble in it.\nDuring week one, feed her the entire meal by hand, one kibble at a time. Have other family members take turns feeding her, and even allow an occasional visitor to do it so that she really gets the concept that humans deliver resources.\nBe sure to include children in the mix — you want her to realize that having small humans around her food bowl is a good thing. In week two, set Gimme’s empty food bowl on the floor and put her meal in a second dish on the counter.\nNow drop a few kibbles into her dish, and while she is eating those, drop a few more. You want her to realize that when a human hand approaches her bowl it is not coming to take her food away; instead, more food is coming.\nAgain, have all the family participate, and include an occasional friend in the mealtime ritual. During week three, put her bowl on the floor with about ¼ of her meal already in it.\nAs she eats, continue to add more kibble, and occasionally add something really wonderful, like a slice of hot dog, chicken, or roast beef. Now you are teaching her that not only does the approaching hand bring more food, it actually brings better food.\nBy now she should be pretty well convinced that having humans around her food bowl is a wonderful idea. In the final week of your food bowl training, continue to drop kibble into her bowl as she eats.\nNow, assuming that she is showing absolutely no signs of food guarding when you reach toward her bowl, pick the bowl up while at the same time you drop pieces of her really wonderful treat on the floor.\nThe message you’re giving to Gimme is that food bowl going away = really wonderful food on the ground. While you have the food bowl in your hand, put a few more pieces of the really wonderful treat in it and set it back down on the ground after she has finished the treats you dropped.\nYou are simply reinforcing the concept that having humans mess with her food bowl is good — it returns to her with even better stuff in it.\nIf you, and others, for the rest of Gimme’s life, continue to occasionally drop great stuff in her bowl while she is eating, she will always recognize humans near her bowl as a good thing and should never develop a food-guarding problem.\nDogs do what feels good, or, as behaviorists say, behavior is reward driven. If your dog is doing something that you want to change, at some level it is rewarding to her.\nFind out what the reward is and you are well on your way to changing the behavior.\nYour attention is a huge reinforcer. Even negative attention (like yelling) is reinforcing — in your dog’s mind, something is better than nothing.\nBabies and Kids Make good things happen whenever babies were around.\nDon’t be stingy here — leave Lady’s dinner kibble at home. Instead, get out the hot dogs, cheese, steak, chicken — whatever Lady likes best — and keep feeding her one tiny piece at a time.\nYou don’t even need to click! her for this; you’re not trying to change or teach a behavior; you’re trying to influence the way that her brain responds to the presence of children. (This is called classical conditioning, like Pavlov’s salivating dogs.)\nWe just want Lady to realize that the presence of babies and small children is a reliable predictor of wonderful treats.\nYou can also have the babies’ parents or babysitters and some well-behaved small children feed treats to Lady and pet her gently so that she realizes that not only do good things happen when kids are around, some of the good things actually come from the children.\nNever leave dogs, babies, and/or small children (under age 10 — or older if the dog is large and active) together unsupervised. No matter how trustworthy the dog, a responsible adult must always be actively observing the interaction between dog and baby human(s).\nGive the dog an escape route. When Junior starts moving, he can be pretty determined and irritating.\nToddler fingers in her eyes, ears, and mouth. Teach Lady how to jump over a low barrier to reach safety if she has had enough baby for the moment.\nDogs who can’t escape their tiny tormentors are more likely to bite in self-defense.\nTeach your dog bite inhibition so that if she does feel compelled to bite in self-defense, she will give an inhibited warning bite rather than a serious bite. (See chapter 22, “A Biting Commentary.”)\nTeach your children to respect the dog. Children should handle dogs gently and kindly. As soon as Junior is old enough to understand, he needs to learn that it is not okay to hit, poke, kick, or pull Lady’s ears or tail. He should also be taught that Lady’s crate is her sanctuary — she is never to be disturbed there.\nUntil he is old enough to understand, it is the responsibility of the supervising adult to prevent Junior from tormenting Lady.\nTeach your children basic dog safety tips:\nNever approach an unfamiliar dog. Never run away from a dog. Never scream near a dog. Stand still when an unfamiliar dog approaches. Do not hug a dog unless an adult has told you that you can hug him. Do not stare into a dog’s eyes. Do not disturb a dog who is sleeping, eating, resting in his crate, or with or near her puppies. Do not play with a dog unless supervised by an adult. Choosing your animal care Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT), a nonprofit organization that promotes the use of positive training methods and provides educational opportunities for all trainers to learn more about the modern science of dog behavior and training. You can access the list of APDT member/trainers at the APDT Web site, www.apdt.com, to find an APDT trainer in your geographical area.\nTraining your dog should be fun! A competent instructor will allow and encourage you to observe a class prior to making the decision to enroll. In a well-run class, dogs and people will be enjoying themselves and having a successful learning experience. Look for an instructor who is approachable and who encourages participants to have a good time. If space permits, an instructor should welcome and encourage all family members and others who interact with the dog to attend class. A skilled class instructor will Provide a clear explanation of each lesson. Demonstrate the behavior(s) that students will be teaching to their dogs. Provide clear instructions and written handouts on how to teach the behavior(s). Give students ample time in class to begin practicing the day’s lesson. Assist students individually with proper implementation of techniques. A skilled and professional trainer will encourage dialogue and be courteous to both canine and human clients alike. You want to be comfortable with the training tools and methods used by the instructor. A skilled and professional dog trainer employs humane training methods that are not harmful to the dog and/or handler and avoids the practices of hanging, beating, kicking, shocking, and all similar procedures or training devices that could cause the dog great pain or distress, or that have imminent potential for physical harm. You have the absolute right to stop any trainer or other animal-care professional who, in your opinion, is causing your dog undue harm or distress. A conscientious trainer will stay informed about innovations in dog training and behavior tools and techniques. Check to see if the instructor is a member of any educational organizations such as the APDT, and whether s/he pursues ongoing educational opportunities. A good instructor will take care to protect your dog’s health in a group setting. Ask if dogs and puppies are required to be vaccinated prior to class and, if so, which vaccines are required. Make sure you and your veterinarian are comfortable with the vaccination requirements. Current clients are a valuable source of information for you. Attending a group class gives you the opportunity to ask clients how they feel about their experience — if they are enjoying the class and feel that their training needs and goals are being met. Because of variables in dog breeding and temperament and owner commitment and experience, a trainer cannot and should not guarantee the results of his/her training. However, an instructor can and should be willing to ensure client satisfaction with his/her professional services. Treats and Rewards Hot dogs or Vienna sausage (you can microwave them to make them less slimy); various kitty treats; trail mix; frozen Italian meatballs; chopped bologna; peanut butter; cream cheese; small cubes of cheddar cheese; chicken — boiled or, even better, fried; liver — freeze-dried or fried; minced steak or roast beef; and the several brands of meat rolls produced for dogs.\nSqueeze cheese is a favorite of mine for exceptionally fussy dogs, and baby food in a jar.\nA spoon or my finger, right out of the jar, or from a squeeze tube.\nFrench toast, Cheerios, croutons soaked in salad dressing, and cheese-filled tortellini.\nSmall chunks of apple and carrot.\nChocolate and onions can kill a dog if consumed in even moderate quantities. Grapes and raisins have also been implicated in numerous dog deaths.\nLIFE REWARDS Things other than food that your dog loves.\nThe more reliably your dog has learned a behavior, the more you can use life rewards in place of treat rewards.\nChasing a ball or a Frisbee Chasing squirrels or birds (in a safe environment) Going outside or coming inside Digging a hole Chewing a chew toy Playing tug of war or chase Taking a walk or going for a car ride Swimming Playing with other dogs Anything else your dog loves to do Training Cues All Done : You are released from whatever I was asking you to do.\nWatch Me: Look at me.\nClick (or a mouth click, finger snap, the words “Yes,” “Click,” or “Tick”): What you were doing at the exact moment you heard the click is earning you a food reward.\nCome: Run quickly to me. (You might also want it to mean “and sit right in front of me.”)\nDog’s Name: Look at me and wait for further instructions.\nDown: Lie down on the ground (not get off something or someone).\nExcuse Me: Walk backward.\nGood Boy: General praise — not a reward marker!\nHeel: Walk by my left side with your shoulder even with my knee.\nJackpot: Exceptionally good effort — you are earning extra rewards!\nLeave It: Whatever you are touching or paying attention to, leave it alone; get off someone or something; don’t touch.\nLet’s Walk: Walk with me without pulling on the leash, or walk closely with me with no leash, but not necessarily in the heel position.\nNo: What you are doing is very bad or dangerous — stop immediately! (Use very sparingly, just for life-threatening situations, and when you do use it, say it like you mean it!)\nOops (or Wrong, Mistake, Sorry): The behavior you are doing will not earn you a reward. (This is referred to as a no-reward marker and is also used sparingly.)\nRelax: Lie flat on your side.\nSit (not Sit Down): Put yourself in the sitting position from whatever position you are in now.\nStand: Stand still on all four legs. Stay: Don’t move from the position I left you in until I release you.\nTake It: Take food or an object into your mouth (the beginning of teaching a dog to retrieve).\nTouch: Touch your nose to a designated target. Wait: Pause. Stop moving, either until I leave or until I release you. (This is less formal than stay.)\nIf you made it this far… Please consider giving me some feedback.

Worth reading multiple times.\nSummary and Highlights You don’t have to be a genius to do well with money. You just need to have the proper set of emotional and behavioral skills. These skills have nothing to do with having a finance degree.\nYou must factor in luck when making financial decisions.\nWhat seems like a dumb financial decision to one person, may be smart from someone else’s point of view. Depending on their life outlook, their mental model of the world, goals, and current circumstances.\nThe world is too complex for an individual to dictate 100% of their outcomes. Remember luck and risk when judging others (or your own) financial success.\nPeople can get lucky when they just as well could have gotten unlucky. Even if it was the same decision. The outcome could have swayed either way.\nBased on this, careful when judging or looking up to people. Not all successful people got there because of hard work, and not all poverty is due to lazyness.\nExtreme cases of luck and risk cannot be applied to other people. The farther the extreme, the more likely the outcome was driven by luck and risk. So focus more on broad patterns, rather than on individuals or case studies. Common patterns are more likely to be applicable to your life.\nWhen things are good or bad, realize that luck or risk played a huge part in bringing you there. Both factors can turn your life around just as quick.\nPlay in a way that lets you no get wiped out from bad luck so you can keep playing until the odds fall in your favor.\nRecognize bad luck when judging yourself for failures.\nGet the goalpost to stop moving Do not risk what you have and need for what you don’t have and don’t need.\nAccept that you might have enough. Even if it’s less than those around you.\nThings not worth risking:\nFamily and friends reputation Freedom and Independence Being loved be people you want to love you. Happiness Compounding You don’t need tremendous force to gain big results over time.\nSmall efforts over long amounts of time give compounding it’s power.\nTime is the secret sauce.\nHigh returns are often one off cases of luck that can’t be repeated.\nFocus on earning pretty good returns that you can stick with for a long period of time.\nSurvival Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there.\nKeeping money requires humility, frugality, and fear that what you have can be taken away quickly.\nPast success is somewhat attributable to luck. So it can’t be relied on indefinitely.\nSurvival should be the conerstone of your strategy.\nLonegevity is what makes the best strategy, compunding, work wonders.\nPlan on you plan not going according to plan. Don’t rely on a single outcome.\nKnow that the path WILL be filled with ups and downs.\nTails Events A small number of events drives the majority of outcomes.\nDo not over react when things fail.\nThings failing more often than they succeed is normal.\nWhat you do today or tomorrow has less impact than what you do when the 1% amount of time when everyone else is going crazy.\nThe masters were wrong just as often as you were. They were just really right when they ended up being right.\nYou can be wrong more than half the time and still make a fortune.\nFreedom is time Highest form of weath is being able to choose what you do with your day.\nValue friendship, being a part of something bigger than yourself, spending quality, unstructured time with your children.\nYour kids want you more than they want things.\nPeople imagine themselves driving the nice car They do not think about the driver.\nWealth signaling does not get you admired.\nRespect and admiration is earned through humility, kindness, and empathy. Not fancy stuff.\nSpending money is the fastest way to having no money. Wealth is what you don’t see.\nIf you spend money on things then you will end up with things and not money.\nRich is current income. Wealth is money not spent. Wealth is opportunity to do whatever you want.\nIt’s hard to find wealth role models because the definition of success in wealth is hidden.\nSaving money Wealth has little to do with returns or income and much to do with your savings rate.\nLearning to be happy with less creates the gap between what you have and what you want.\nA powerful way to increase your savings is to increase your humility.\nDon’t give a damn about what others think of you.\nSave for no reason Life will throw curve balls at you.\nHaving extra money will give you more options to wait for the right opportunity. It lets you have time to think and to change course on your own terms.\nSoft skills - like communication, empathy, and flexibility, will give you an advantage in a world where Intelligence is hyper competitive.\nReasonable can be better than rational Reasonable helps you stick to it over the long haul. Which is what matters most when managing money.\nBeing able to sleep at night is more important than math.\nIt’s easier to justify “minimizing future regret” in real life than it is on paper.\n“Love your investments”\nDoing what you love provides the endurance to succeed. Rational thinking does not tie in your emotions to your results. Making it more likely that you will jump ship when the waters are rough.\n“Things that have never happened before happen all the time” History is not a map of the future.\nThe majority of historical outcomes are driven by events that were impossible to predict.\nYou can learn general takeaways from history, but stay away from things that are too specific.\nPlan on your plan not going according to plan Recognize that uncertanty and randomness are a part of life. Render the forcast unnecessary.\nHave a margin of safety. Plan so that you can endure a range of outcomes. So that you can survive long enough to let the odds fall in your favor.\nAssume your future returns will be slightly lower than historical average.\nDo not risk anything you are unwilling to lose.\nBarbell your money. Be paranoid with some, but unwilling to risk the other portion.\nTry to avoid single points of failurre. You can’t plan for the things that are too crazy to cross your mind.\nRelying on a paycheck with no savings is a single point of failure.\nYou will change Imagining goals is easy and fun. But the reality of hitting that goal may be not as good as you imagined.\nPeople are aware of how much they have changed in the past, but underestimate how much they will change in the future.\nAvoid extreme ends of financial planning. Balance at every point becomes important to minimize future regret and keep you in the game for the long haul.\nAccept the reality that you might change your mind. Move on as soon as possible.\nHave no sunk costs. They make you a prisoner of your past self.\nAbandon past goals without mercy. If they do not best suit your needs. The quicker it’s done, the sooner you can go back to compounding.\nNothing is free. We often don’t stick to things because we were unable to identify the price to succeed.\nThe price of successful investing is voliility, fear, doubt, uncertantly, and regret. Be willing to pay it.\nThis is a fee for getting where we want to go. Not a fine for doing something wrong.\nBeware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are. Investors have different goals and time horizons. Factors that an investor pays attention to make different prices worth it or not worth it. Depending on those goals.\nWe can see how much others spend on assets. But we do not see their goals, worries, and aspirations.\nYou must understand your own time horizon and act on those. Rather than acting on the decisions of people playing a different game than you.\nThe seduction of pessimism Optimism sounds like a sales pitch, pessimism sounds like someone is trying to help you.\nOptimism recognises a possitive outcome even with setbacks along the way.\nProgress happens too slowly to notice. But setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.\nGrowth is driven by compoundings. Setbacks are driven by single points of failure or loss of confidence. Both of which can happen in an instant.\nStories are more powerful than statistics. The more you want something to be true, the higher chance you are to believe a story that over estimates the likelyhood of that thing to be true.\nThe biggest risk is that the likelyhood of what you want to be trues isn’t even close to reality.\nWe are overconfident in our beliefs because we fill in what we don’t know to make a mental model of the world. Relying on skill more than on unknowns.\nKey Takeaways Find humility when things go right. Find compassion and forgiveness when things go wrong.\nLess ego more wealth.\nManage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.\nIncreasing your time horizon is the key to being a better investor.\nBe okay with things going wrong. You can be wrong more than half the time and still make a fortune.\nUse money to gain control of your time.\nBe nicer and less flashy.\nSave. For no reason.\nDefine the cost of success and be willing to pay it.\nWorship room for error.\nAvoid extreme ends of financial decisions.\nYou should like risk because it pays off over time.\nDefine the game you are playing.\nRespect the mess.\nHow Maintain a lifestyle below what you can afford.

    "content": "Summary and Highlights If you have a change of heart, your marriage will be on a new footing.\nA change of heart is the force that erases the distress in relationships and gives you a fresh start.\nA relationship dysfunction—a conflict, boredom or resentment—needs no healing time and is always reversible. A change of heart can occur in an instant.\nMany marriage counselors say the past its unexpressed emotions and habit patterns—and poor communication are the “bad guys” that cause mental and relationship distress. These are the symptoms of relationship distress, not the cause. The cause, the real bad guy, is insecurity.\nPainful memories, negative emotions, habit patterns and bad communication are all symptoms of insecurity.\nInsecurity is the source of distress and all counterproductive behavior.\nThoughts of insecurity periodically pass through our minds. If we dismiss these thoughts, we will remain secure, our ideal selves: easygoing, joyful, compassionate and wise. If we harbor our thoughts of insecurity, we end up in a state of distress.\nMarriage counseling doesn’t work because:\nTherapists tend to teach couples to struggle with their problems instead of giving them a fresh start. Therapists use low mood therapy instead of high mood therapy. Clients are given misinformation, the same misinformation that explains why so many therapists get divorced. When couples go to a marriage counselor there are three possible outcomes: (1) they get a fresh start, (2) they stay together and “cope with” a tense or sour marriage. (3) they separate.\nCoping involves struggling (a more honest term for “working on”) with problems and expressing your feeling about them. Coping takes time and work and provides only temporary relief.\nIt is about as effective as releasing steam without turning down the heat.\nThe strength of their marriages lies not in their ability to cope with their problems, but in their ability to keep their bearings and to stay close.\nPeople mistakenly believe that pain and effort are an inevitable part of relationships. They believe that analyzing their problems and living patterns will change them.\nAnalyzing problems makes you an expert on your problems. It doesn’t change you.\nWhen partners probe and analyze each other’s faults, as they learn to do in most marriage counseling, they become insecure, defensive and resistant to change. They bring out the worst in each other.\nLOW MOOD THERAPY\nThere are actually two kinds of therapy: low mood therapy and high mood therapy.\nDuring low mood therapy the client is in a low mood because he’s probing problems and other negative thoughts.\nIn high mood therapy, clients engage the thoughts we have in high moods—insights, non-contingent positive feelings and big-picture perspectives.\nTHE LOW MOOD THERAPY PROCESS\n1. The counselor asks clients to list their problems. This step makes all the problems vivid in the clients’ minds, thereby lowering their spirits.\nCounselor and clients delve into each problem in detail. They look at its cause, its implications and associated memories, emotions and fears.\nProblems now seem so formidable that clients are discouraged.\n2. From this discouraged state of mind, the counselor and clients attempt to solve relationship problems. The process is usually painful and unproductive.\nThe counselor concludes that the couple needs to put extensive “work” into their relationship. He or she then asks if they are willing to make the commitment. The couple considers how painful and unproductive their efforts have been and are reluctant to throw “good money after bad.”\nThe high mood therapist Sees that extracting misunderstandings, misinformation, overreactions, grudges and discouragement from relationships lays a foundation for a fresh start. This observation keeps the high mood therapist hopeful and patient.\nShe doesn’t focus on problems. Instead, she explains personality and mood distortions and shows how misinformation damages relationships.\nOnce this understanding strikes home, the couple begins to glimpse the same possibilities for their relationship that the therapist sees. They see the viability of a fresh start. At this point, the couple sees their relationship history as a nightmare from which they are awakening.\nA characteristic of very low moods is that every little problem looks like the tip of an iceberg.\nIn the ignorance of low moods, they think the “real” Ben and Jennifer have finally surfaced.\nTheir relationship is punctuated by insecurity, their mood held down by their fearful thoughts.\nThey bring their problem to a high mood therapist. Instead of analyzing their pattern of criticism and withdrawal, she reassures them that they have innocently brought out the worst in each other. She shows them that their behaviors have become exaggerated because they have been stuck in a low mood.\nShe explains how moods distort our thinking and perceptions. She explains that if they make allowances for them, moods will have no lasting effect on relationships.\nMoods are the constant shifts in perspective built into our experience of life. Our thinking and therefore our perceptions of life are a function of mood changes. Our thoughts are more optimistic, lighthearted, and wise when we are in a high mood.\nThis book emphasizes thinking because it is the steering wheel for a happy life and satisfying relationships. Thinking is like breathing—we do it continuously from birth to death.\nThinking is like a function that allows every human being to create a personal reality.\nEach thought creates a feeling that makes the thought appear real.\nThere is no way to enjoy a relationship if our minds are full of painful thoughts. We can’t enjoy anything while our minds are analyzing and criticizing.\nAs our thought processes get healthier, more responsive (less habitual), our relationships improve dramatically.\nWhat makes people so rigid, so predictable in their thinking?\nMind-sets, which we also could call thought systems, create unique realities for people in the same way a film creates an image on a movie screen.\nA mind-set predisposes us toward specific feelings and behaviors.\nMind-sets limit our perceived options and, in that way, cast our lot in life.\nOften people think of feelings as things to work through or deal with.\nBut feelings were meant to be a barometer to help us maintain our emotional equilibrium.\nFeelings provide our moment-to-moment experience of life. They tell us the extent to which our perceptions are distorted by our moods and thought systems.\nThe counselor finds and fans any spark of intimacy that exists between the partners. The couple begins to feel closer to each other and more hopeful about the relationship.\nThe counselor describes how insecurity distorts behavior in relationships.\nHe or she suggests that the relationship is not in as bad shape as it seems. The clients begin to see the spiral of emotional reactions that destroyed the closeness they want. They begin to see innocence in themselves and each other.\nThe counselor demonstrates that maintaining a sense of well-being is all it takes to make the relationship enjoyable and easy.\nThe counselor teaches them the building blocks of human psychological functioning: thinking, moods, mind-sets and feelings.\nUnderstanding these principles enables the couple to create and maintain a sense of well-being and to feel warm and respectful toward each other, even in hard times.\nAccording to the couple’s needs, the counselor discusses relationship-related subjects such as what the past really is, how to forgive and forget, how to use feeling as a compass of relationship well being and how compatibility is the result of the feeling, not the cause.\nTo get a fresh start in a marriage, we must know that the so-called “issues” in a marriage are symptoms and not causes of disharmony.\nA misunderstanding of the deeper dynamics of a relationship.\nCompatibility has to do with how you think and feel and not with how different you are.\nTHE COMPATIBILITY MYTH Don’t personalities have to be compatible for a marriage to be successful?\nA couple must feel compatible and close for a marriage to work.\nComplementary and incompatible are two conclusions about the same situation, two sides of the same coin.\nWhen differences are viewed with respect, partners are viewed as complementary.\nRespect and affinity are the feelings that turn the personality differences into assets in a relationship.\nThoughts of incompatibility are a sign that the respect and affinity level in the relationship has slipped. It is always humbling to realize that today’s incompatibility was yesterday’s refreshing difference.”\nThe two perspectives are just one thought apart.\nHOW THOUGHT CREATES INCOMPATIBILITY To be close to our mates and enjoy their company. Closeness, a warm feeling of affinity, is the cake and the frosting.\nDissimilar values and economic incompatibility don’t matter if the emotional connection is there.\nWarm feelings give people a positive outlook.\nIt is only when we lose good feelings that the qualities we think we want in a mate become important to us.\nIn fact, the number and strength of our wants is an excellent indicator of relationship well-being.\nWhen we start to feel we are not getting what we want in our marriage, we know our level of intimacy is low.\nBeing close helps us to get the things we want, such as a good sexual relationship or material luxury, because intimacy leads to good teamwork.\nCloseness brings out the best in each person.\nIt also inspires both partners to attend to the things that are important to their mates, making it easier to realize their joint and individual goals.\nIt is the thought of incompatibility that creates the feeling of incompatibility.\nNatural compatibility is upset by negative thoughts and judgments.\nIf I am with a person and I entertain negative thoughts about how that person lives or is, my positive feelings begin to disappear.\nWhen people are insecure, what they want and don’t want feels a lot more compelling to them.\nBut when our spirits are high, we’re more understanding.\nWe can see both sides more easily. We see that “issues” are not as important in the grand scheme of things as we thought they were.\nIn other words, it’s normal for us to be stubborn when we’re in a low mood and magnanimous when we’re in a higher frame of mind.\nThe cake is feeling contented inside. In your marriage, the cake is sharing good feelings as a couple. But couples can lose sight of the closeness in their marriage when they search for the specific conditions they think they want. Often, the only reason they want those specific conditions is that they assume they will bring more love.\nBe careful not to hurt each other’s feelings over the issue.\nWe have to be more gentle with each other and more open just to enjoy each other.\nThoughts of compatibility or incompatibility are a compass that reacts to your level-of-closeness to the other person. When you are feeling close to your mate, you will not entertain thoughts about how compatible you are.\nRemember that today’s incompatibilities were yesterday’s refreshing differences.\nThose differences represent opportunities to learn from each other. If you take the role of the student, the respect you show your mate will raise the level of the relationship.\nCommunication enhances a relationship that is on track. If a relationship is off track, communication is, at best, like brushing your teeth right before you eat candy.\nAt worst, communication is tantamount to brushing your teeth with a tooth brush dipped in plaque.\nTHE COMMUNICATION MYTH Doesn’t clear communication automatically improve the quality of a relationship?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nPositive communication does deepen the feeling between two people.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nThe couple told the counselor they had a “communication problem.” They said they had bad feelings toward each other. The counselor responded, “It’s a good thing your communication is poor. Just think how terrible you’d feel if you could get your ill feelings across to each other.” The counselor then helped the couple find a close, warm feeling in their relationship—he facilitated a change of heart. When they felt close, they saw the problem in their relationship was the feeling, not the communication.\nCommunication is a pipe through which feelings pass. If the feelings are positive, the relationship will be uplifted. If they are negative, the couple’s level of closeness will drop.\nIn a relationship, then, the quality of feelings that passes through the communication pipe determines the state of that union. What brings new closeness and goodwill to a relationship is more positive feelings—not more talk. Good feelings are expressed in all kinds of ways besides talk. They radiate from your presence.\nWhen we communicate from drunkenness, anger or happiness, what we say can only be understood within the context of that state of mind.\nIf the two of you start a discussion at 7:10 P.M. and at 7:30 you feel closer, you are making progress. Your level of closeness is a moment-to-moment measure of your progress.\nThere is no such thing as a productive discussion that alienates its parties.\nThere is no such thing as an unproductive discussion that brings two people closer together.\nCommunication takes care of itself. It’s the feelings that need to be tended to.\nEach of you is probably seeing things a little bit differently than before, a little more optimistically. (They nod.) If you share these positive thoughts, they will help the relationship to spiral up. Believe me, these positive thoughts are just as real as the negative thoughts. It’s only force of habit that makes you dismiss positive thoughts and stick with the negative.\nYou have to learn to trust it. Any time you can share hopeful, high-spirited thoughts, your relationship will benefit.\nPositive thoughts are just as real as negative thoughts and feelings. In fact, they’re more real! Negative thoughts are always associated with fears of the future and negative memories of the past, and only the present is real.\nLeft off here You don’t have to feel this way all the time to have a good marriage. You just have to remember that when you slip into the doldrums, your thoughts and perceptions will go with you. If that happens, don’t take your thoughts too seriously.\nIf you communicate those negative thoughts to each other, believe me, they’ll seem more real. If you must share them, though, warn the other person it’s your mood that’s speaking, not you\ncommunication isn’t nearly as important as how we feel when we communicate\nCommunication is to relationships what mopping up spills is to housecleaning. You need to clean up messes, but the idea is not to make them in the first place.\nWhen your spirits are low is when you are most compelled to “talk about things” and least advised to do so.\nMany of the statements you make then will seem false or damaging from the perspective of a higher mood.\nIf you must communicate when you are both down, head for the high ground—the positive and hopeful.\nYou can always share possibilities and visions, discuss how difficult it is to see things accurately in a low mood, how much you want the same thing, how deceiving appearances can be and the things for which you’re grateful. These subjects will lift your mood as you discuss them.\nListen for the spirit behind the communication. When you are touched by feelings, you have gotten what that person has tried to say.\nYou will feel enriched and the other person will feel heard.\nUse your level of closeness as a compass to assess how well your discussion is progressing. If, after ten minutes, you are feeling closer to each other, continue on the same track. If you feel more distant, stop, and give it another try later\nIf you want to continue, start all over and head the discussion in another direction. There is no such thing as progress in a discussion that alienates the participants\nWhen our thinking is negative, our feelings and perceptions will exactly reflect those negative thoughts and feelings in that moment. If we trust those perceptions and feelings, our lives will take a turn for the worse.\nTHE MOOD MYTH\nIsn’t “getting to the bottom of it” the best way for a couple to handle a low mood?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nIt’s important for you to support your partner when he or she is feeling low\nThe best way to help a person in a low mood is to be understanding and overlook the effect mood has on his or her behavior\nIf you maintain your sense of well-being, your partner can make contact with your sense of well-being for support, much as a drowning person might reach toward someone on the shore.\nIf you try to reach out and pull the person to shore however, you are likely to end up in the water, too\nWhatever mood a person is in is his present reality. If you try to coax him out of it, you are likely to end up in a low mood yourself\nWarmth, understanding, compassion and a respectful sense of humor are the only forces that can help a person who is struggling with a low mood\nHuman beings constantly move up and down the mood continuum. Some mood shifts are dramatic and some are imperceptible.\nThe thinking that creates low feeling states often has many of the following characteristics:\n1. Our mental activity—or thinking velocity—increases.\n2. Our thinking gravitates to problems and dissatisfactions\n3. We experience a heightened but distorted sense of immediacy. For example, we think we must do something right away about our circumstances\n4. We feel self-conscious. It seems we are the center of everybody’s attention\n5. We have a pessimistic outlook. We notice limitations and are blind to possibilities\n6. We entertain many negative thoughts emotions and concerns\nIt is not the mood, the feeling state, itself, but how we relate to it that determines the quality of our life. It is our thoughts about our moods that cause us distress. We fear the moods are “real,” that they will last forever\nUnderstanding the relationship between thought and feeling determines our level of well-being independent of our moment to moment moods.\nWith this understanding we become grateful when our mood is high and graceful when it is low\nUnderstanding how our thinking is related to our feelings and perceptions allows us to calibrate to moods.\nWhen people don’t realize they have moods, they are hoodwinked into thinking it is “reality” that is changing, not just their thoughts.\nAll people tend to experience high moods in the same way—they’re relaxed, energetic, in good humor, patient, carefree and compassionate.\nThere is a large variation, however, in how people experience low moods\nSome get aggressive and belligerent when they are down. Others become quiet and distant\nMoods, even low moods, provide an important function in the human experience. Moods are a navigational system. The specific feeling state we are in at a given moment tells us the quality of our thinking in that specific moment.\nWe know that our thinking is the cause of the feeling even though we may not know what those specific thoughts are\nWhen people lose sight of the source of feelings, they mistakenly attribute their feelings to outside sources. They mistakenly think that our feelings inform us about the world at large\nare my feelings being generated from within via thought or are they being imposed on us somehow by circumstances and events beyond our control?\nThe conclusion is that all feelings come from our thoughts\nIf life is an elevator, moods are the floors we visit. Let’s explore five floors (among an infinite number):\nGloom and Doom My high school mates are doing so much better than I am\nI’m getting old and my job is a dead end. Why is everyone always judging me?\nAll Is Not Right With The World There are many villains out there\nI don’t like my life. It’s not fair that I put out fifty-two percent to my wife’s forty-eight. I can see many defects in my job\nI’m okay. Life’s okay My job is good when I have the right attitude. My mate isn’t as bad as I thought\nI feel contented.\n1. Gratitude\nPeople are so well meaning. There are so many great jobs\nI’ve got a better deal than my mate. Life is so interesting\nInspiration My work energizes me\nThere is no way to go wrong in life. My mate is my best friend. I have more ideas than I can use\nIf you could remember that thoughts and feelings coincide, you would be a comfort to Helen. You would also be less likely to get carried away by your work during your temporary moments of insecurity. Also, you wouldn’t take Helen’s words and actions personally when she’s in a bad mood. You’d be able to relate to what she is going through. Your heart would go out to her—not in sympathy but in compassion for what it’s like to be frightened by your own thoughts. As you begin to see past her moods, she will begin to see past them, too.\nSoon, moods will just come and go without any drama or conflict\nNothing needs to be “done” about moods. They come and go on their own. The less attention we give them, the better.\nWhen you are in a low mood, don’t make important life decisions. Your thinking is not as sound as it is in a higher state of mind.\nWhen others are in a low state of mind, put everything they say or do in that context. Don’t hold it against them or try to argue with them.\nBeing understanding will help others to feel better.\nAs you begin to see people’s moods, you will see how to stay out of their way when they are low. You will also learn to what extent you can trust what they say and do.\nStay open to the possibility that your mood might change at any minute. Just realizing that “it is just your thinking” will usher in new thought that will change your feeling state\nPeople generally handle emotion in one of two ways:\nThey indulge their emotions and ride an uncomfortable roller coaster\nThey run away from them and become distracted and hardened\nThere is a third alternative: realize that emotions are only thoughts.\nenjoy emotional stability, while staying in touch with their feelings.\nTHE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS MYTH\nDon’t negative emotions have to be expressed to clear the air?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nYou want to be aware that you are in a negative frame of mind.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nUnpleasant or negative emotions are thoughts that contaminate the natural good feelings that exist between people. If you eliminate your negative thoughts, you will experience greater warmth and love toward your partner.\nrealizations that can offset negative emotions:\nNegative emotions are just thoughts; they have no life of their own.\nWhen a thought is not in your mind, it does not exist.\nNegative emotions only rear their ugly heads when we are in a troubled state of mind. When we are feeling magnanimous, we experience positive thoughts.\nYou will see that the same event or person provokes different feelings when your state of mind changes.\nYou might see a car as a “clunker” if you’re in a bad mood—and a “classic” in a good one.\nThe easiest way to rid your mind of negative emotions is to dismiss them as you would any distracting thought.\nWe constantly can and do dismiss thoughts we deem extraneous and nonproductive\nIt is only our misguided judgment about what is extraneous and unproductive that supports the presence of negative thoughts in relationships\nHuman emotions are illusory\neach emotion was a mirage created by the convergence of circumstance, perception and interpretation\nEach emotion was understandable in context. As the interpretation changed, the emotion changed accordingly\nIf emotions can be set aside during emergencies, can they be set aside anytime? Sure\nAs you take the incident less personally, your feelings become more positive\nYour emotions are always a perfect indicator of how subjectively you are viewing life.\nEmotions do not provide information about the world around us. They do serve as a compass that indicates the quality of our thinking and our present capacity to make sound judgments\nEmotions are like goldfish. They will grow to any size depending on how much attention they get\nNegative emotion tells us our mental health is suffering, just as physical pain signals that we are abusing our bodies\nA change in perspective is needed to right our thinking and regain feelings of well-being\nresentments are just thoughts that can be dropped\nall you’re doing is following a ritual: you give yourself permission to drop the thought as soon as you express it\nNegative thoughts that sit in our minds tend to take on increased focus and importance.\nThey’re like a burr under a saddle that causes more irritation the longer it stays there. This increased focus and importance cause what you referred t as the “build-up” in your head.\nBut these thoughts don’t have a life of their own.\nThey gain importance and attention only because you give it to them\nThe importance you place on a thought is subjective. The importance you assign it determines the power that thought has over you.\nIn this case, you’ve given great importance to resentments\nYou believe resentments are more important and less “dismissible” than other thoughts.\neach person’s belief system writes the script and we innocently\nact it out\nDon’t take negative emotions seriously\nthey provide information about the state of your mind, not the state of the world.\nWhen your thinking is contaminated by negative emotions, make as few decisions and engage in as few interactions as possible. This keeps these emotions from\nspilling over into your life.\nWhen negative emotions occupy your mind, quiet your thinking until they pass.\nIf your heart goes out to the “wrong-doer,” you will feel compassion rather than resentment\nTHE COMPASSION MYTH\nIsn’t there such a thing as being too understanding?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nThere is such a thing as acting against your better judgment because you feel sorry for someone.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nCompassion is a wonderful, warm feeling. To suggest you could have too much of it is like suggesting you could have too much joy or too\nmuch health\nunpleasant feelings distort our thinking and lead us to actions we later regret\nCompassion is misunderstood and undervalued. Without compassion and understanding, interpersonal friction erodes the good feelings in a relationship.\nCompassion is our innate interpersonal lubricant. It is a\nblanket of warm feelings that protects us from the rough edges of personalities\nWhenever people exhibit counterproductive behavior, you can be sure they are in an insecure state of mind\nIf they were feeling more secure, they would have the wisdom to avoid those behaviors.\nWhen we perceive counterproductive behaviors in others\nour response is either resentment or compassion.\nWe feel resentful if we focus on the behavior and how it affects us. We are compassionate if we look beyond the behavior to the troubled state of mind that motivated it\nWe remember how this state of mind wreaks\nhavoc with our common sense. Our hearts go out to the person\nCompassion also protects us against harsh self-judgment. We gain tolerance of our own imperfections. When we feel compassion we can identify with the humanness of life’s\npredicaments\nWe are reminded of how we all occasionally get lost in our thoughts and lose our perspective. Our feelings of humanity are rejuvenated and our spirits rise. The other person gains hope because our spirits have risen from contact with him or her.\nThus, compassion helps the troubled person as much as it protects you. Warm, respectful, hopeful feelings are the best gift you can give a person in distress. Compassion provides the proper emotional environment for the person to recover his or her sense of\nsecurity. Compassion always delivers an “I understand” message.\nWhen another person appears to be imposing on us, we are at a crossroads. One fork in the road takes us to resentment, and the other to compassion. Which road we take depends on whether we think of ourselves or the other person\nThe following illustrates one\nperson’s experience of the two forks in the road.\nCompassion insulated the father from the annoyance of the crying sounds\nthere is nothing more impractical in life than resentment. Compassionate feelings protect us.\nResentment\nand hate obstruct our view of life and impair our objectivity\nCompassion protects us from reacting unproductively to the behavior of others. It calms us down and makes us feel more secure\nTo feel resentment, you look for malice and notice how incidents affect you. To feel\ncompassion you notice the pain that motivated negative behavior\npeople relax and perform better in the presence of a supportive person than they do under the watchful eye of a perfectionist.\nHuman connectedness comes in two forms: sympathy and compassion\nWhen we\nsympathize, we identify with another person’s specific plight\nWe relate it to a similar event that happened to us and re-experience all the same emotions\nWhen we are compassionate, however, we connect with the general human feeling of the other person\nfeelings of identity and understanding allow us to be appropriately\npatient with the frailties of others (and ourselves\nsympathy forces us to re-experience painful memories. Compassion, on the other\nhand, is a here-and-now recognition of the true nature of life—that we all get crunched by our thought systems sometimes\nchart below summarizes the differences between these two types of human connectedness:\nSYMPATHY\nCOMPASSION\nAccompanying Feeling:\nSadness\nWarmth\nWhat You Identify With:\nThe Specific Problem\nThe Impersonal Fact of Pain and Loss in Life\nHow You Feel Afterwards:\nDrained\nExhilarated\nHow They Feel Afterwards:\nConcerned\nExpanded and Strengthened\nBetween the extremes of compassion and anger/resentment, there exists a wide range of\nresponses\nTAKING IT PERSONALLY\nYou read malice into the situation. You feel outraged and vengeful.\nUPSET\nBehavior is seen as intentional. You feel angry and upset\nBOTHERED\nBehavior is seen as negligent and unacceptable. You feel irritated and annoyed\nACCEPTING\nBehavior looks innocent. You find the incident interesting\nUNDERSTANDING\nYou see the insecurity behind the behavior. Your heart goes out to him. You feel warmth, compassion\nAMUSED\nWe all have our moments.” You see the big picture and enjoy it.\nRemember that compassion helps you\nand others.\nBelieve that every person deserves to be understood. There is probably someone who would list you as an exception to this rule just as you may be tempted to list others.\nTo find compassion, look beyond the behavior to the troubled state of mind that motivated the behavior\nDISSATISFACTION\nA MENTAL ILLNESS\nA focus on dissatisfactions creates a negative tone that undermines and weakens a relationship.\nTHE DISSATISFACTION MYTH\nWon’t resentments build in a relationship unless annoying behaviors and dissatisfactions are brought up?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nA relationship does need a self-correction mechanism.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nhas your heart been in the right place? Deep down, have you tried your best to do right by that person?\npeople easily see their own good intentions but have difficulty seeing the good intentions of others\nIn order for a relationship to work, an attitude of trust must be present\nWe all must live as if our partners have our interests at heart\nWhen the emotional atmosphere of the relationship is cold and negative, the participants back into a protective shell of ego. They begin to look out for themselves. The\ndeeper they retreat, the less motivated they are to look out for the other person\nWhen a couple is relaxed and happy together they naturally look out for each other’s interests. The goodwill they feel motivates them to please each other, and their relaxed state of\nmind enables them to see themselves objectively and implement self-correction\nA mind-set is a rigid, limited way of seeing life, an automatic predisposition. A mind-set is like a pair of sunglasses: it colors the way life looks to you.\nThey are self-validating. For example, suspicious people look for signs of betrayal and find it everywhere. They unwittingly interpret innocent actions as deceitful and detect deceitful actions\nwhere none exist\nThey are externally validating. Have you ever had a perfectionist looking over your shoulder? Perfectionists tend to make you nervous. You make more mistakes than usual. Perfectionists note these mistakes\nof course, and the cycle continues\nThey lock you into an uncomfortable, but familiar, feeling state\nA suspicious person lives in feelings of mistrust. A perfectionist lives in feelings of irritation. These feeling states are so familiar it is hard to imagine\nany other experience. Fortunately, all mind-sets provide an uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling. If we mistrust that feeling, we expose the mind-set for what it is.\nAnything we spend a lot of time thinking about will become a mind-set\nexpressing negative sentiments erodes goodwill\nif you don’t take your dissatisfaction and criticism too seriously, you will never develop a critical-dissatisfied outlook\nRemember, despite appearances to the contrary, your partner wants to be a good mate or friend just as much as you do\nProblems in your relationship signal that warmth and affinity are low. Realize that you have probably fallen into a lower state of mind where your sense of perspective is severely compromised\nKnow that appreciation and trust are\npossibilities just as real as problems\nBenign neglect—intentionally overlooking a thought—will often have positive effects on a relationship. Once you drop your ill will, your mate will feel more secure and will be likely to correct the conditions that\nconcern you. Benign neglect can free your mate from the pressure your dissatisfaction places on his or her ego\nIf you feel compelled to comment on another person’s behavior, wait until you have a positive attitude and feelings of\nwarmth and respect toward that person\nRemember that discretion is the better part of valor. Unless there is at least a ninety percent chance that your talking to the person will improve matters, don’t try it. If your action is unlikely to help, it\nmakes little sense to add more ill will to the relationship.\nApproach the person as gently as possible to minimize the likelihood of defensiveness\nThe only way we can really change is to change the way we feel inside. Our thinking changes our outlook, and our behavior\nfollows suit\nTHE CHANGE MYTH\nIsn’t it true that people can’t change?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nPeople find it difficult to change their behavior patterns at will.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nPeople change by becoming more themselves and less their conditioning\nWhen a person gets insecure, he retreats to his conditioned personality, a coat of armor made of bad habits\nand pretenses\nThe way to facilitate change is to treat people with understanding and goodwill\nGoodwill quells insecurity\nIt invites people to\ndrop their armor and be themselves. When the armor goes, people regain the innate assets of wisdom, creativity, humor and compassion—assets that increase productivity and responsiveness in life.\nstages of personal change:\nOBLIVIOUS\nJUSTIFYING\nCOMPULSIVE AWARENESS\nIn the compulsive awareness stage, you should pay as little\nattention as possible to what you see. Seeing what you are doing in life is good. It prompts you to change. But reacting emotionally to what you see is not helpful. Any feelings of guilt, any willful attempts to change or analyze your behavior are misguided\nIt’s sufficient for you to\nsee you have counterproductive habits that disappear when you notice them.\nCHANGE\nthose who have accepted their mates have low motivation to change them and those who haven’t don’t have the right attitude to do so.\nfeelings of happiness and goodwill inside him, feelings that make life worthwhile. I told him thoughts of insecurity preempt these positive feelings. I said that people do counterproductive things only when they lose\ntheir sense of well-being. These negative behaviors make sense in context because they offer temporary relief from the bad feelings\nThe feelings are just thoughts. When we are insecure or frightened, we all tend to act counterproductively. Once our thinking calms down, the good feelings return.\nonce a person\nhas a moment of truth, he or she is never the same.\nHe looks at his early years of crime as one would look at a bad dream—with\nbewilderment and relief.\nTHE DOMINO EFFECT\nChange is a domino effect: a thought generates a feeling that, in turn, motivates a\nbehavior\nClearly, the way to change a behavior is to change the feeling that motivates the behavior—the first domino. You do this by changing your thoughts\nAs our level of well-being goes up we are increasingly insulated from the temptation of habits. Conversely, when we are insecure, habits seem to have a strong hold on us.\nOBSESSED\nIn a very low mood. We lunge into habitual behaviors without seeing the thoughts that precede them\nCOMPELLED\nIn a low mood. The thought of the habit is constantly on our minds. It seems irresistible to us. Our willpower has an uphill battle\nAT CHOICE\nIn a higher mood. The two thoughts—“to do” or “not to do”—carry equal weight. Willpower works at this level\nTEMPTED\nIn a high mood. The thought of the habit comes to mind occasionally. We can easily dismiss it knowing it is just a thought with no life of its\nown.\nFREEDOM\nIn a very high mood. The idea of the habit doesn’t even occur to us. This is the level where\neffortless change occurs\nThe best way to change a habit is to raise your level of well-being—become happier. When you are happier, all your habits are easier to resist. If you raise your level of security enough, the habits won’t even occur to you\nIt is a mistake to struggle with your habits. In doing so you are likely to wear yourself out, become discouraged and end up making yourself insecure.\nfear is misunderstood excitement. When we contemplate change, we get a bubble of energy. If we are in a state of well-being, we will feel\nexhilarated by that energy. If we are insecure, we will get frightened. Thus, our reaction to change is another clue to our state of mind\nWith real change, we don’t make it happen. Instead, we notice it after it has happened. This change happens because it doesn’t occur to us to act in the old way.\nThe internal factors—what we think, how we feel—are forces behind change. If you\ntry to change at the level of behavior, you are trying to make the tail wag the dog.\nPeople respond to our demeanor. We either bring out the best in people or we bring out the worst\nTHE PUNISHMENT MYTH\nIsn’t it true that punishment and pressure are necessary to deal with a person who stubbornly repeats counterproductive behaviors?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nPeople struggling with habitual behaviors need some type of support\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nagain. You are upset and embarrassed. You have been in this unpleasant situation before. You wonder why you always\nend up like this. You don’t feel secure enough to admit you are troubled. You are even less likely to admit that you might have contributed to the problem. The people around you are upset with your behavior. What type of treatment do you want from others right now—humiliation\npunishment, criticism, anger or pressure\nProbably not. Understanding and restored faith in you probably would be your first two choices. Those are the attitudes that bring out the best in you, too.\nPressure and punishment worsen\ncounterproductive behavior\nPeople with destructive habits are feeling insecure. What they need is understanding and support that will help them regain their bearings. Even behaviorists say punishment will not change the person; at best it will only change the\nperson’s behavior\nSelf-esteem, confidence, wisdom and understanding are what allow people to drop destructive habits and make sound decisions in life. All of these qualities are brought out by goodwill, not by pressure and humiliation.\nyour state of mind alters the behavior of people around you. The way people act around you depends on which of the following two\ninteraction cycles is triggered by your state of mind.\nWhen approached with goodwill, people listen more openly and respond more cooperatively\nEven when an issue is sensitive or negative, a positive internal feeling leads to a productive discussion\nThe goodwill of each party brings out the goodwill in the other parties to create a positive rapport cycle\nOn the other hand, if you are feeling irritated at someone, you will find yourself in a negative frame of mind and your interactions\nwith people are likely to be unrewarding.\nWhen you are in a chip-on-the-shoulder state of mind, you think in terms of pressure and intimidation. Pressure and intimidation insult people and set up a battle of egos\nwhen\nyou interact from feelings of irritation or anger you tend to bring out the worst in people, creating an ill will cycle.\nDiagramed below are the ill will cycle and the positive rapport cycle\nIt is easy to see why people locked in an ill will cycle experience frustration and complain that people are difficult. When a person feels ill will, he or she is living in a world of active egos and rigid personalities, with scant opportunities for progress and\nlearning\nWhen a person feels warm and respectful, the above dynamic occurs. He brings out the best in others who know his heart is in the right place. They listen openly, egos at rest, and return respect and warmth by putting themselves out for that person.\nProgress and\nlearning are built into this dynamic. The positive rapport cycle maximizes teamwork and minimizes interpersonal friction.\nA CHANGE OF HEART—THE VEHICLE FOR INSTANT CHANGE\nHuman beings have a miraculous ability: we can change our minds. We all can shift from a negative, judgmental perspective to a positive outlook without any change in circumstances. For lack of a better name, let’s call this phenomenon a change of heart\nA change of\nheart has the following characteristics:\nIt takes a person from a negative, evaluative stance to an appreciative stance. ^\nIt creates such a complete change in perspective that the person has trouble relating to the way he saw things only minutes earlier.\nIt can happen any time, without warning. People are often surprised by it\nA change of heart is preceded by a moment of truth\nThe following chart shows how different the same thing looks before and after a change of heart.\nThe change in perception provides us with a change in feeling\nBefore a change of\nheart, our view is critical and our feelings are therefore negative. After a change of heart, our view is appreciative and we feel grateful. Simultaneously, the nicer feelings generate more positive perceptions, thus creating a positive spiral.\nBefore a Change of Heart\nAfter a Change of Heart\nBob is a difficult person.\nBob is a “character.”\nLife is turbulent.\nLife is eventful.\nThat person is annoying.\nThat person is endearing\nOur house is old.\nOur house has character.\nour old thinking drops away and we can take a fresh look at our circumstances\nAll that is needed for a change of heart is a momentary quiet mind. The man in this story moved from a negative to a positive state of mind without the slightest change in circumstances\nPositive feelings are so basic to our nature that they fill our minds whenever\nthere is the slightest amount of room\nChange of heart is the mechanism for saving and improving relationships\nIf we interact when we feel insecure, our insecurity creates distortions\nmisinterpretations and misunderstandings\nIf you are in a state of angry indignation, others will fight you tooth and nail.\nIf you are in a state of annoyance and irritation, others will drag their feet.\nIf you are in a state of contentment, others will join you.\nIf you are in a state of appreciation, others\nwill put themselves out for you.\nIf you are in a state of deep gratitude, others will pull out all the stops to help you.\nAs your level of goodwill rises, people\nbecome ever more cooperative\nI know this may sound simplistic to you, but people don’t respond well to an\nadversarial stance. They take offense, as your son has done, and become very stubborn. It humiliates people to be punished and chastised.\nI mean that you don’t have a feeling of goodwill toward your son. You’re not on his side right now.\nchicken-egg dilemma. You and your son are in a vicious cycle. You’re bringing out the worst in each other. Does that make sense?\nYour reactions to each other have polarized your behaviors. Believe me, it’s very common for people to move toward behavioral extremes when egos get involved.\nyou have to get out of an adversarial stance and get your heart in the right place. If you continue your battle with your son, he’ll just dig in\nfurther. The ego is amazingly persistent. People will bite off their noses to spite their faces if they’re committed to a battle of wills. I’m sure your son would rather count you as friends than as enemies.\nDon’t judge him too harshly. Remember that all of your behaviors have been exaggerated. Think for a moment. Wouldn’t you like to start all over as friends and work it out together?\nAbsolutely. A relationship can always get a fresh start. Kids are particularly good at forgiving and forgetting. What about you, Martha?\nall you have to do is forgive and forget all the crazy things that have been said and done. Pretend it’s all a bad dream.\nNotice your inner feeling, your state of\nmind, before you deliver a sensitive message. If you have a chip on your shoulder, get your heart in the right place. Look inside to find more understanding and compassion. Remember that everyone deserves to be seen in the most\nfavorable light. When your heart is back in the right place, you will bring out the best in others.\nWhen you notice defensiveness in a listener, stop, wait and approach that person again with more gentleness and\ngoodwill. That person will likely respond in kind.\nDON’T DEAL WITH PROBLEMS\nTRANSCEND THEM\nWhen I tell clients not to work on problems they look incredulous, as if I am telling them not to eat or drink. That’s because everyone assumes that the only way to solve problems is to work on them.\nIronically, a focus on problems is the\nnumber one relationship killer. It lowers your spirits and makes things look worse than they really are.\nThere is a way to get where you want to go without focusing on problems. This way is so natural and effortless it doesn’t look like you’re\ndoing anything.\nTHE PROBLEMS MYTH\nIsn’t it best to deal with problems by discussing them up front whenever they bother one partner?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nA relationship needs a way to evolve and find solutions to the issues at hand.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nProblems” don’t really exist. They are mirages that appear to exist when certain conditions are present, such as an insecure state of mind. Problems are nothing more than situations seen through a filter of insecurity.\nSITUATION + INSECURE MIND-SET\n= THE ILLUSION OF A “PROBLEM”\nIf you have a sore on your arm, the last\nthing you should do is poke at it. Your doctor would treat the wound gently, creating the best possible healing environment. So-called relationship problems should be treated the same way\nThe thoughts around these issues trigger emotional reactions. If we are not\ncareful, we will spend our time dealing with these emotional reactions instead of the issue. To treat an emotional sore spot, we should create a secure environment where the problem area can heal.\nOften there are many solutions. These solutions are usually obvious to the dispassionate observer, but we cannot see them when our minds are clouded by emotional reactions.\nThere are two basic human thought models: the problem mode and the solution mode\nThe problem mode\npeople analyze, rehash, defend their positions and attempt to convert others to their viewpoint\nthey achieve a compromise “solution” that none of the parties really likes.\nThe solution mode\nWe clear our minds instead of filling them with details. We reflect, look and listen.\nSuddenly\nout of nowhere, we get an insight\nthey end up feeling close, and they always reach a consensus\nFaith is what keeps us in the solution mode—faith that there\nare perfect solutions to our problems and that those solutions will be visible once we calm down and take a fresh look.\nHow You See It\nHow You Will Feel\nCatastrophe\nDepressed\nProblem\nStressed Out\nSituation\nInterested\nOpportunity\nGrateful\nWindfall\nExhilarated\nThe possibilities and limitations you notice are a good gauge for your state of mind. If you see lots of possibilities, your head’s in a good place. If your head is full of limitations, you are in trouble. Push escape, reset or whatever else\nwill clear your mind. Possibilities will enter your head when you regain your sense of perspective.\nWhen you\nhold distracting thoughts like doubts and alternatives in your mind, you can’t put your full attention on what you are doing\nThat would be a good definition of commitment: dismissing doubts and\nalternatives in the name of enjoying your project or relationship more.\nThere always comes a time when an issue becomes easy to talk about. Every situation gets “ripe.”\nWhen you think or talk about an issue and your feeling of well-being drops, you should back away from it. A low mood will handicap your thinking and increase your susceptibility to emotional reactions.\nThere is an obvious answer to every\nproblem. Being too close to the problem is the reason these solutions are not apparent. That’s why consultants can instantly see solutions to problems that clients have struggled with for years.\nA problem does not look like a problem\nwhen it is seen in the right light. It looks like a portrait of circumstances, or even an opportunity.\nTHE CONFLICT MYTH\nIsn’t some amount of fighting or arguing always part of a healthy relationship?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nWe might entertain occasional antagonistic or\njudgmental thoughts about our mates.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nAntagonistic thought need not be acted out through arguing or fighting. When negative\nthoughts are taken in stride, they will not affect the relationship adversely.\nUnderstanding resides midway between thought and action. When we understand that thoughts have no power without our will, we can easily keep them from dictating actions. The progression from\nthought to behavior is a function of our level of understanding. In marital disputes the progression is usually as follows\nDepending on your state of mind, your reaction to “conflicting” viewpoints can range from horror to delight. You may be:\nHorrified at the ignorance and stubbornness of others\nFearful that other people might impose their misguided views on you\nBothered that others don’t see the truth\nIrritated that others have different viewpoints\nInterested in the fact that we are all different\nGrateful that we can learn from each other\nAmused\nDelighted\nHOW PEOPLE DEAL WITH OPPOSING VIEWS—THE OPTIONS AND THE RESULTS\nBLOCK AND CENSURE THE OTHER\nPERSON’S OPINION\ncensorship often leads to an underground resistance that can become formidable. When parents use this strategy with their children, the children may run from home or create a “secret life.\nSTRONGLY OPPOSE\nYou allow the person to express his or her differing opinion, but you attack it with all your forces.\nYour strategy is to put up so much resistance that the person will choose to keep his opinions to himself. In a marriage, a partner\nemploys this strategy by putting down the spouse whenever a view is expressed\nARGUE\nThe intent of this strategy is to change the other person’s view\nThe assumption is that if you could show the other person the logic that supports your view, he or she would drop the faulty view and adopt yours. The problem is\nthe other person also has a logic, which supports his or her view as strongly as your logic supports yours\nArguing polarizes viewpoints. Often you end up supporting a position you don’t even agree with just for the sake of being “right.” Egos do not allow us\ndiscuss things constructively\nACCEPT OR ALLOW FOR DIFFERING VIEWS\nUsing this strategy, you simply accept that we\nall have different realities, without judging or assessing, just as you accept certain laws of physics such as gravity\nallows the other person to express his or her view without opposition\nStated views tend to evolve. When you get a clear view of your opinion, you will\nusually improve upon it\nExpressing the ideas in a friendly forum lets people examine what they think and learn from the process. If the environment is adversarial rather than receptive, the person is defensive, unable to learn and ever more rigid in that view\nWELCOME AND RESPECT DIFFERING VIEWS (“CULTURAL EXCHANGE”)\nThe most productive strategy in communicating is to learn from other views\nThere is always a grain of truth in every view that opposes yours\nThe difference between accepting and welcoming differing views is measured in the amount of respect\naccorded to others’ opinions. The more respect the better the response\nOthers make that extra effort to express themselves. They become better listeners. The rapport that results from this strategy creates a high level of intimacy\nWhen you feel compelled to argue, you\nknow you are momentarily insecure\nAll belief systems are self-validating and inclusive enough to provide an answer for every argument\nThe quality of your teamwork as parents depends on how you respond to differences of opinion\nIf you respond well to them, different points of view are not a problem. If you respond counterproductively, then differences of\nopinion lead to conflict and stress.\nlook at the truth in what Karen is saying rather than what you disagree with. Karen understands children need some limits\nsome structure to guide them\nJust listen and you’ll get some respect for her thinking. You might even be able to learn from each other.\nKaren understands that children need guidance and firmness. She reacts to you when you give in to the children in a moment of weakness. She thinks this\ncreates a bad model for them.\nI know I shouldn’t go overboard to please them like I sometimes do, but I’m reacting to Karen’s rigidity. I also know it doesn’t work to base my treatment\nof the kids on my reactions to Karen\nI’ll have to admit I’m too harsh and overbearing sometimes, Gerry. I respect that you’re more patient and more forgiving.\nYou are beginning to get respect for each other and to examine your positions. Can you see how the discussion is progressing with the stance you’re taking now?\nEach of you has a tremendous amount to contribute to your parenting relationship. Karen, you are grounded in setting limits and teaching the children responsibility. Gerry, you are grounded in\nthe realization that whatever is done with the children should be done with the right spirit. If you respect each other more you can learn from each other.\nappreciate that he insists on things being nice for the kids. I was brought up in a family that was pretty grim and serious. One thing that attracted me to Gerry was his commitment to happy endings. I realize how I had begun to take that for granted\nhave tried to make him more hard-nosed instead of learning to be more flexible myself.\nGerry. Could you talk to us about dealing with specific subjects, like chores? Should we require the children to do chores?\nChores help a child learn responsibility and contribute to the family. Chores must be administered in the right spirit, though, or they lower the child’s self-esteem and foster a bad attitude about responsibility.\nIf you listen for what you disagree with, you’ll hear the personal belief component and end up arguing. If you listen for the truth in what the other person says, you’ll hear the\ncommon sense component and learn from the interaction.\nLet’s each make a list of what we think each kid should do. Then we will go over it and see if we think they can do each thing. We will make sure we are not giving them too much.\nRealize that arguing and fighting are not productive. The insecurity in a conflict environment minimizes learning.\nSee different viewpoints as an opportunity to understand each other better.\nListen for the truth in what the other person is saying when there is a difference of opinion. The other person will find it easier to communicate in a non\nadversarial atmosphere. You will find yourself learning from each other.\nTHE STALE MARRIAGE MYTH\nDon’t most marriages eventually “grow stale?”\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nIf relationships don’t evolve and deepen, they do tend to get stale.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nAs marriages evolve, they quiet down. They get deeper rather than more stimulating. More stimulating, is like a back scratch. Deeper is like\na back massage\nDeeper is more satisfying but less dramatic. It seldom occurs to people that the reason they seek so much excitement is that excitement is not very satisfying\nA couple’s sex life reflects this principle during the first two years of marriage. At first\nsex is the major source of intimacy in marriage. As the relationship evolves, intimacy comes more from sharing and companionship than from sex\nThese more subtle forms of intimacy are also more profound. An “I love you” over the phone, or a moment of silence together after\nthe kids are in bed, can leave one with a warm feeling for hours. Intimacy becomes more than an experience limited to the bedroom\nCouples who don’t appreciate what deepening is become concerned when their relationship quiets down. They think\nsomething’s wrong\nThey worry they aren’t as sexually active and don’t pursue excitement as much. This concern creates unrest in their minds and, thus, in the relationship\nUnrest lowers the intimacy level. Now, they have neither excitement nor intimacy.\nThey need to see that as a marriage quiets down it becomes more fulfilling. The partners feel more relaxed—more themselves—in each other’s company, dropping even the most subtle pretenses. They become more open to life and to each other\nenjoyment with less effort. They become more appreciative. When it is time to be out in the world, they are more rested and refreshed. When a couple acquires a taste for contentment, they truly appreciate the deepening feelings in their marriage\nLEVELS OF RELATIONSHIP\nCONFLICT LEVEL\nBoth parties are poisoned by anger and insulted by the treatment they are receiving\nThey also feel insecure and off-balance, which brings out their worst. There may even be physical fighting and the relationship may feel raw and numb. Communication is difficult and usually makes things worse. A jump in the level of understanding brings hope, patience and\ntemporary peace\nCOPING LEVEL\nThe good news at this level is that the fights can be kept under control. The bad news\nmaintaining control is a full-time job. The relationship feels unpleasant and strained, burdened by judgments and expectations. Surprisingly, feelings of superiority and guilt often occur simultaneously. Partners find themselves worn out from the constant\ndemands of “handling” the relationship. Communications are strained and warm feelings are scarce. A jump in the level of understanding helps develop compassion and goodwill.\nCOOPERATION LEVEL\nPlanning, coordination and compatibility are achievable at this level because goodwill is present. Both parties trust the good intentions of the other and view counterproductive behavior as innocent and fueled by insecurity\nThey give each other the benefit of the doubt. Where incompatibility and lack of alignment exist, good communication and mutual support fill the gap. A jump in the level of understanding here provides greater faith and trust\nSYNERGY LEVEL\nProblems, stresses and incompatibilities don’t even appear at this level. Individual differences are buffered by feelings of appreciation, respect and gratitude\nBeing together energizes the parties. They talk less and share more positive\nfeelings. This level brings out the best in everybody. A jump in the level of understanding brings even deeper feelings.\nSOUL MATES\nYou carry the other person in your heart at this level. The couple feels strong kinship and intimacy—as friends, lovers, working partners or family. They want to spend as much time together as possible. Their shared moments have a timeless quality—a little bit goes a long\nway. A jump in the level of understanding leads to even more depth of feeling.\nstop trying to analyze and “work on” the relationship and concentrate on enjoying each other\nIf we learn to take leaps of faith we don’t have to fight change until we understand it\nRespect familiarity and comfort in a\nrelationship.\nTake the transitional periods in stride. During these periods, the relationship may seem old because the new experience of the relationship has not yet emerged. Those periods are a sign that a\ndeeper, more satisfying way of relating is on the way.\nIT’S NEVER TOO LATE\nTO GET A FRESH START\nit hurts to be upset and to bear grudges. Anger and resentment are painful feelings. Why would it be smart to try to feel this way?\nself-inflicted\nemotional pain, resentments and grudges are just bad habits that make things worse by adding more insecurity to a situation\nForgiving and forgetting are the answer\nTHE MYTH OF “THE PAST\nDoesn’t the past doom some relationships? Isn’t there such a thing as “too much water under the bridge?”\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nSome couples get so discouraged by their painful memories that they give up.\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\nWhen a relationship has been troubled for a long time, the partners usually have accumulated painful memories that overshadow their feeling of love. When the feeling of love is obscured, they begin to view each other in a negative light that creates more unpleasant\nmemories\nThis in turn lowers the\nfeeling level, which darkens their outlook further.\nThis downward spiral continually lowers the level of goodwill between the partners\nFor the marriage to be “saved,” the spiral must be reversed. This is always possible. There is no such thing as a point of no return in a\nrelationship. Relationships can always get a fresh start.\nThe cycle is reversed when partners empty the pool of painful memories from their minds. When the painful thoughts are gone, they will be replaced by warm, positive thoughts and\nfeelings that lay the foundation for a fresh start. Forgiveness sets this process in motion.\nForgiving results from clearing unwanted thoughts from our minds. We forgive when we use our power of understanding to strip these thoughts of their negative charge\nOnce a\nmemory is forgiven, it is easily forgotten\nForgiving and forgetting don’t have to be learned or practiced; these skills are innate\nIf people can\nforget the past in emergencies, they have the power to forgive and forget at will.\nPeople think of forgiveness as a generous act, but it is actually very self-serving. If you have painful memories, you suffer\nForgiveness is the act of seeing those thoughts with understanding. Understanding lets us see the humanity of others and cast offending events in a more positive light. Understanding depersonalizes the event, transferring it from the “this is what happens to me” category to\njust another example of what happens in life.\nWhen couples decide to forgive and forget, they relieve themselves of a tremendous amount of pain and begin a new life with new thoughts, new feelings, new possibilities and a new perspective on the past\nA fresh start also\nleaves couples feeling warm and close. Partners look nicer, more well-meaning to each other\nhabitual thoughts about their mates are ruining their fun in life and dominating their thinking\nPeople\nact out their insecurity by engaging in counterproductive behaviors\nOthers return tit for tat.\nNeither person’s behavior represents the way he would act if he approached the situation with wisdom. When you see the distortion in your behavior, you’ll notice the other person’s behavior is also distorted—it may not represent his deeper\nintentions. Now both partners have reached a position of humility.\nWhat the couple needs now is compassion. They need to see the innocence in each other’s behavior, even in the act that launched the downward spiral of reactions\nevery misguided action is accompanied by an insecure state of mind\nIf you look into the miscreant’s eyes instead of at\nhis behavior, you will always see these negative feelings\nIf he had a sense of well-being, he would have the wisdom to see his actions as counterproductive.\nThey will see themselves as unwitting players in a comedy of errors, and they will see their history in the light of understanding. They will feel warm toward each other.\nThe past is no more real than a dream. Once an event is over, it becomes a mere memory. The past has only as much power as you give it through your thoughts\nthink of the event as a plus. Your inspired state of mind generates insight that helps your life even more. In retrospect it seems you “lucked out.”\ntake ourselves and our thoughts less seriously\nSee the possibility of forgiving and forgetting\nSee how essential it is to your mental health to drop painful thoughts from your consciousness\nFind the humility to see that you are both in this together.\nSee the innocence you both possess.\nRemember that any relationship can get a fresh start today. That exhilarating feeling is always only a thought away!\nTHE INTIMACY MYTH\nDoesn’t intimacy require a large investment\nof time, talk and energy?\nTHE GRAIN OF TRUTH\nWhen couples don’t know where intimacy comes from, they have to exert lots of energy to\nget a little intimacy\nspend a few moments together with a high level of presence.\nIf you were more there in the moment, your presence would help to draw Ron out of his distractions. There is nothing like a strong human presence to draw a person into the moment.\nlevels of involvement as they apply to intimacy:\nOBLIVIOUS\nYou are so absorbed in your thoughts you\nhardly notice the other person. He or she may feel insulted or awkward about your neglect.\nDISTRACTED\nAt this level, your thoughts draw you away\nfrom contact with the other person. It is an effort to be fully present. The experience is unpleasant because it takes so much effort. The other person accuses you of not listening. You feel stressed and dissatisfied.\nPRESENT\nIt is easy and satisfying for you to feel present with the other person. You are warmed by the contact. People say you are nice to talk to.\nIMPACT\nThe feeling at this level is very strong. You are touched by the people you are with. Your mind is so free of distraction, you lose your sense of time. The experience is very rich. The person with you feels some chemistry with you\nYour\nintimacy automatically deepens over time.\nONE MIND\nYour mind is so free you understand each other with very little conversation. You feel so\nclose to each other you would swear you have known each other longer than you actually have. This level just seems to happen and when it does, it is memorable.\nIN A NUTSHELL\nRealize that any extraneous thoughts we have on our minds detract from our closeness to others.\nBegin to appreciate feelings of closeness.\nRemember that intimacy is a momentary experience that has nothing to do with time or conditions\nCOMMITMENT\nThe more engaged we are, the larger our capacity for commitment.\nFull involvement works out best for all parties. What limits our level of mental\ninvolvement is insecurity. When we indulge concerns, fears and doubts, we are too distracted to be fully involved. We are holding back.\ncommitment is very self-serving\nCommitment can be defined as a wholehearted, single-minded predisposition to\na person or activity\nPeople make a commitment in order to enjoy someone or something, not because they already enjoy someone or something\nDistraction and ambivalence tell you your commitment is weak. Commitment is a stance\ntoward life, a predisposition to get the most out of each experience by dismissing thoughts and reactions that detract from its value.\nCommitment to other people means seeing each person in the best possible light. To do this, we dismiss personal emotional reactions\nthat might lessen enjoyment of others.\nThe ultimate interpersonal commitment is to forgive and forget any residual thoughts that interfere with affinity and respect. Our special commitment to our mates requires us to dismiss adverse circumstances and emotional\nreactions\nThe benefit you get from commitment is peace of mind on both sides. Your partner\nbenefits from knowing you are committed to maintain respect and affinity. He need not fear that circumstance and personal reactions will hurt the relationship.\nCommitment prepares the mind for full involvement and guards against distractions.\nPutting your whole heart into a relationship is the only way to get maximum value from it\nmy focus on shortcomings and problems was souring my perspective and compromising the experience\nConsumed by problems and fearful thoughts, you are too preoccupied to notice, never mind enjoy, what’s going on around you.\nThe problem is, you are taking your thoughts so seriously that you are lowering your well-being. As your level of well-being drops, you entertain more negative thoughts, and the downward cycle continues.\nINDULGING YOUR CONCERNS\nFears, doubts and concerns are like flies that keep you from enjoying a picnic. Negative thoughts contaminate relationships\nYour\nconcerns and fears will dominate your experience if you are too insecure to dismiss them.\nFREE TO ENJOY\nJUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET\nYou refuse to indulge in insecure thoughts that would keep you from enjoying the other person. You dismiss any negative thoughts. As a result, your involvement level is high enough to set a spiral of closeness in motion: you get more relaxed so that you feel closer, so that\nyou enjoy the other person more, so that you get relaxed and so on.\nSWEPT AWAY\nThe feelings of love and gratitude are so strong you think you have found “the one.” This level evolves naturally from the “jump in with both feet” level.\nPeople in love see the beauty in life. Call\nA couple with a warm affinity bring out the best in each other. They treat each other like royalty and respond eagerly\nFeelings\nof security subdue their egos and disruptive personality traits\nA positive emotional climate elicits creativity and wisdom. A positive relationship makes geniuses and heroes out of ordinary people\nWarm feelings in a relationship foster good teamwork. The better the feeling, the more productive the partners are\ntogether. “Synergy” is an advanced level of teamwork that allows partners to work as one. Working at a synergy level is effortless, efficient and invigorating\nCouples with a high level of goodwill are insulated from adversity\nAdversity brings\nthem closer together and strengthens their bond. Goodwill makes it easy for them to correct mistakes in the relationship. They trust each other. When negative experiences occur, partners are grateful that negative experiences are an\nexception to them\nour feelings come directly and exclusively from our thoughts. Any feelings we have in any given moment will always reflect our thinking in that\nmoment\nthe sole contributor\nTHE PRINCIPLES\nThe Principle of Thought is that every\nperson on earth has the power to create ideas, images, perceptions and memories within our own minds.\nThe Principle of Consciousness is our ability to form feelings from our thoughts. All of our feelings come from our thoughts\nThe Principle of Mind explains that we are part of a larger, intelligent system. As part of this larger system, we can experience the power of new thought and, therefore, new experiences.\nthought is transient. Our thoughts are constantly changing. Even the same memory or idea will look different to us at different times of the day. Because of the ever-changing nature of our\nthinking, we can characterize thought as being illusory rather than fixed and solid.\nThoughts come and go uneventfully through our minds if we let them do so. When we fixate on a thought, it stays in our mind. Thoughts stick around according to how much\nimportance we place on them\nChronic unwanted thoughts, and their respective feelings, are innocently held in place if we believe them to belong to external realities rather than being temporary and unimportant\nIf you enjoy your partner and think she’s\nwonderful, then that is what your thoughts are telling you. If you see beauty and goodness in your partner, then that is what your thoughts are telling you. It’s no less your thoughts when you see faults and ugliness in your partner\ndo you think that thoughts rooted in shallow, trivial observations are your truest reality? Or is your truest reality those thoughts you have that are\nrooted in something deep, sincere and fundamental?\nTHE GET OVER YOURSELF MODEL\nBy requiring your partner to be in charge of your emotional state, you are not only giving them an immense, impossible job, but also\ndisregarding your own power over your thoughts, feelings and emotional reactions\nYou don’t have to spend time looking for your own sensitivities and avoiding your partner’s sensitivities. You can accept that\ngetting upset, or moody, or resentful is a part of the natural ups and downs of life and doesn’t necessarily mean that something is wrong\nRather than holding on to upsetting feelings, you can spend your time enjoying your partner’s company and relaxing into the\nrelationship\nWhen you do get into an emotional reaction, it helps to notice that you have lost your bearings and that any unwanted feelings you are having are temporary. You can remind yourself that it is realistic and beneficial for you\nto get over your unwanted thoughts and feelings. Nothing wrong or bad is happening; it’s just a natural part of being human\nYou’ll find that the ‘Get Over Yourself Model’ has a learning curve. You will get better and better at getting over your emotional\nreactions and returning to the well-being you had before the reactions occurred.

I didn’t assume why he said the things he did\nand I asked questions to find out what he meant when I was confused.\nLISTENING TO KEEP THINGS INTERESTING\ncouples\nwho have recently fallen in love are often the most curious about how their partners see the world. They frequently ask the question, “Why do you feel that way?”, or say, “Tell me more about that.” The curiosity and interest is what keeps the relationship fresh and interesting\nCouples commonly revert to the ‘bad listener model’ when they talk to each other. They project their own thinking on each other and don’t even notice that they are doing it. They just fill in the blanks and assume the other person thinks the way they would think under\nthose circumstances. If they do this often, they lose curiosity for the unique ways their partner actually sees the world\nWhen a couple sees listening as an opportunity to get into another person’s world\nthere is more clarity in the relationship, fewer misunderstandings and more interest and excitement between partners. It feels nice to be heard, but it can feel just as nice to listen\nPerhaps one of the most effective tests for if you are a good listener is if you feel compassion for the person you are listening to\nCompassion is when your heart goes out to the speaker.\nHaving compassion proves that you are taking in what someone is saying and that you are allowing it to affect you\ncompassion\nis healing. It erases what ‘has been’.\nIf what ‘has been’ is a fight or a heated argument, compassion erases the hurt and anger. If what ‘has been’ is resentment from a misunderstanding, compassion erases it. Compassion is a cure for grudges. Compassion\nis a powerful feeling, and it helps relationships move in a positive direction. And it comes quite naturally when people truly listen to each other.\nCAN YOU BE HAPPY WITH ANYONE?\nturn their attention away from each other’s frailties and instead focus on the goodness and humanity that is in each of them\nyou desire to have a good relationship with your\npartner, and therefore you already desire to see the good in them\nWhen you see the good and innocence in another human being, you realize that whatever frailties they have are not as devastating to the relationship as it had looked like before\nJust as a person slipping on ice will contort their body in strange ways to regain their balance, the person emotionally off-balance will behave in puzzling ways in an attempt to regain their emotional bearings.\nBeing happy with someone does not come from finding the ideal mate for you, but from you being able to hold on to your goodwill and not focusing your mental energy on\ndissatisfaction and judgments. And when you do have those thoughts, remember that it’s just your way of being sometimes. It doesn’t mean anything. You can easily bounce back and regain your goodwill and perspective\nIf you fill your head with judgments, concern and evaluations of your partner, then you will not be able to fully enjoy the relationship",

    "content": "This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.\nSummary and Highlights You can’t fix most problems with rules, any more than you can with laws. They’re too inflexible.\neight basic emotions:\nJOY PAIN LOVE ANGER PASSION FEAR GUILT SHAME\nEvery emotion belongs in one of these categories.\nLying is about controlling someone else’s reality, hoping that what they don’t know won’t hurt you.\nIf she finds out and breaks up with you, you’re not really in a relationship anyway. With all the lying, you’ve been in your own world the whole time.\nIf you’d committed to always telling her the truth in the first place, you would have thought twice before cheating on her. So start now, and maybe it’s not too late to include her in your relationship.\nWhen things get hard for you, you start blaming the person you’re with.\nNone of this has anything to do with her. Just you.\nIf you ever want to be truly happy in this lifetime, you have to recognize that you’re using sex like a drug to fill a hole. And that hole is your self-esteem. Deep down, you feel unlovable.\nNothing’s going to change until you take deliberate and committed action to change it.\nThe Addiction Cycle,” with four terms—preoccupation, ritualization, acting out, and shame \u0026 despair\nCELIBACY/ABSTINENCE CONTRACT\nI WILL REFRAIN FROM THE FOLLOWING:\nMasturbation\nImplicit or explicit pornographic material\nFlirtatious, seductive, romantic, or suggestive comments or behavior\nSeductive attire\nSexually overt or covert contact with another person or myself\nSecretive sexual fantasizing Objectifying, fantasizing, or obsessing We don’t meet many people who truly love us, who accept us for who we are, who put us before themselves. Maybe a parent or two if we’re lucky, perhaps a couple of previous partners. So what kind of person rewards someone’s love with lies, betrayal, and pain?\nA selfish person. A coldhearted person. A thoughtless person. An asshole. A liar. A cheater. A guy who thinks with his dick.\nGuilt is about breaking the rules. Shame is about being broken.\nIf you have true intimacy with your partner, you won’t need to seek sex outside the relationship.\nIf you’re addicted to sex, you’re probably co-addicted to something else, like drugs or work or exercise, and this is because you’re afraid of intimacy and you’re afraid of your feelings.\nSex must never be secretive, abusive, a way to alter feelings, or empty of a committed intimate relationship.\nIf one big-T Trauma is a ten on the scale and a little-t trauma is a one, then ten little traumas can be just as powerful as one big Trauma.\nWhen children experience trauma, they tend to absorb the feelings of their abusers and store them in a compartment in their psyche that we call the shame core. It contains the beliefs I am worthless, I am unlovable, I don’t deserve. Any time you feel one down—or inferior—to someone or you feel one up—or superior—those are false beliefs generated by your shame core. Because, in reality, every person in the world has equal worth and value.\nTo survive painful beliefs and feelings, we often mask them with anger. That way, we don’t have to feel the shame behind it.\nThe payoff of anger is mastery, control, or power.\nSo the anger makes you feel better and one up. And when you use sex to restore power or feel better about yourself in a similar way, this is what’s known as eroticized rage.\nBeing overcontrolled as a child sets you up to lie as an adult.\nSo the theory of sex addiction is that when you feel out of control or disempowered, you sneak around and act out sexually to reestablish control and regain your sense of self.\nIntimacy is sharing your reality with someone else and knowing you’re safe, and them being able to share their reality with you and also be safe.\nWhen I see another woman, for example, I just tell myself, Bright red apple, wrong orchard.\nTHE MALE DILEMMA\n1. Sex is great. 2. Relationships are great. 3. Relationships grow over time. 4. The sex gets old over time. 5. So does she. 6. Thus the problem.\nWe can’t just keep waiting for lightning to strike every time we need fire. We have to make fire ourselves.’ They probably thought he was crazy, rubbing rocks and sticks together. Today they’d diagnose him as obsessive-compulsive. But then he gave them fire, and all of a sudden everyone was doing it. You can’t get anywhere as a civilization without that kind of original thinking and focus. It’s people with compulsive behaviors who change the world.”\nA lot of times, people in a family think it’s just one person who causes all the trouble. But a family is a system, and a sick person is the product of a sick system.\nFine stands for fucked up, insecure, neurotic, and emotional.\nThey say here that there are three ways of raising children. The first is functional bonding, in which the parents or primary caregivers love, nurture, affirm set healthy limits with, and take care of the needs of the child.\nThis creates a child who has healthy, secure self-esteem and relationships.\nBut then there’s neglect, when a caregiver abandons, is detached from, or doesn’t appropriately nurture the child. This can range from a parent who isn’t physically present, to a parent who is physically present but emotionally distant, to a parent who doesn’t provide adequate care or safety, to a parent lost in a work, sex, gambling, alcohol, or other addiction. If you grew up feeling unwanted by or unimportant to a parent, this is a sign that neglect likely occurred.\nThis creates wounded children, who are often depressed and indecisive, see themselves as flawed and less valuable than others, and feel they can’t face the world alone. In relationships, they tend to have what’s called anxious attachment. They may feel like they’re not enough for their partners.\nBecome so wrapped up in their relationships that they lose sight of their own needs and self-worth; and be emotionally intense, passive-aggressive, or in need of constant reassurance that they’re not being abandoned.\nHere, they call this type of person a love addict.\nThe third type of parenting: enmeshment.\nInstead of taking care of a child’s needs, the enmeshing parent tries to get his or her own needs met through the child. This can take various forms: a parent who lives through a child’s accomplishments; who makes the child a surrogate spouse, therapist, or caretaker.\nWho is depressed and emotionally uses the child; who is overbearing or overcontrolling; or who is excessively emotional or anxious about a child. If you grew up feeling sorry for or smothered by a parent, this is a sign that enmeshment likely occurred.\nEnmeshed children lose their sense of self. As adults, they usually avoid letting anyone get too close and suck the life out of them again. Where the abandoned are often unable to contain their feelings, the enmeshed tend to be cut off from them, and be perfectionistic and controlling of themselves and others.\nThough they may pursue a relationship thinking they want connection, once they’re in the reality of one, they often put up walls, feel superior, and use other distancing techniques to avoid intimacy. This is known as avoidant attachment—or, as they put it here, love avoidance.\nAnd most sex addicts, according to this theory, are love avoidants.\nMaybe that’s the female dilemma, She marries someone who’s giving her love and romance, but over time she gets taken for granted or turned into a maid or becomes a baby factory or gets cheated on.\nThere’s not a single emotional need of hers that’s filled by her husband. Then he has the nerve to complain that she’s not sexual or attractive when he’s drained the life out of her.\nThe ninth emotion is the death emotion. It’s just feeling nothing.\nSelf-deprecation is still self-worship, It’s the flip side of the same coin. It’s still about self.\nRemember that humor is a wall. It’s a form of denial, just the same as repression, rationalization, globalization, and minimization.\nEVERYTHING THAT’S WRONG WITH YOUR BEHAVIOR AND WHY IN 1,800 WORDS OR LESS\nIn the beginning . . .\nYou were born.\nAnd like all infants, you were completely vulnerable and dependent, with a new developing brain and no understanding of the world.\nIn a perfect world . . .\nYour parents would be perfect. They would be dedicated full-time to taking care of your physical and psychological needs, always making the right decisions, setting the healthiest boundaries, and protecting you from all harm, while preparing you to eventually take care of your needs without them.\nBut in the real world . . .\nNo one is perfect. Neither your parents, nor the other people who play a role in your upbringing. Therefore, along the way some of your developmental needs don’t get met.\nAnd the problem is . . .\nWhen one of your needs doesn’t get met, however big or small, it can leave a wound.\nThese wounds are known as childhood trauma. Each instance or pattern of trauma can create specific core personal issues and relationship challenges—and if these are left untreated, you’re likely to pass your wounds on to the next generation. Since this trauma occurs early in life, it can affect social, emotional, behavioral, cognitive, and moral development.\nIt’s not always overt or intentional . . .\nMost commonly, people think of trauma as coming from hateful perpetrators who are knowingly and willfully abusive. But even parents who think of themselves as loving or well-meaning make mistakes, cross boundaries, or simply do their best with the limited internal resources they have. And this covert, often unrecognized abuse can, through its constant repetition, leave wounds just as deep as those created by a single malicious act.\nIt can be an emotional scar . . .\nIn your earliest years, you’re the center of the universe. Everything revolves around you. So wounds can come from caregivers who are either out of control or completely detached from their emotions around you. When Mom is always full of anxiety as she’s breast-feeding, Dad comes home in a rage every time he has a rough day at work, or Stepdad is depressed by his money problems during the rare moments he spends with you, you soak up these emotions like a sponge, often erroneously taking the blame or responsibility for them. Even if a parent falls ill and passes away, it can seem like abandonment or something you made happen if you’re too young to understand death.\nIt can be physical . . .\nMost people understand that it’s not okay to physically harm or even spank a child. But here’s an example that’s not as obvious:\nAny invasive medical procedure—even something as commonplace as a circumcision or getting stiches—may register the exact same as physical abuse if you experience it in your first few years of life. You may even start to distrust your caregivers for bringing you to an unfamiliar place and not keeping you safe.\nOften it’s intellectual . . .\nAfter the first few years of life, you start to separate from your parents. In this period, it’s their job to help you become your own person and confidently stand on your own two feet in the world. Here, a whole new set of problems can arise—especially when parents try to over-control you, habitually criticize you, or unreasonably expect you to be perfect. Other families adhere to such rigid rules that any manifestation of a child’s individuality is immediately attacked as a threat. All these can lead to esteem problems later in life.\nOr it can take over your entire identity.\nWithin a dysfunctional family system, each child tends to play a different role that helps the family survive and detracts from its real issues. These can include the revered hero, the troublemaking scapegoat, the neglected lost child, the people-pleasing placater, and the mood-lifting mascot. Later in life, these roles (as well as birth order) can lead to corresponding personality issues, whether it’s the hero’s judgmental perfectionism, the scapegoat’s explosive anger, the lost child’s low self-esteem, the placater’s denial of personal needs, or the mascot’s impulsive irresponsibility.\nBut it’s not easy to see your own core issues . . .\nYour oldest beliefs, behaviors, and adaptations have not justbeen reinforced by decades of habit, but are built deep into the architecture of your brain, which is busy building new neural connections at an astounding rate in early life. As the saying goes, “Cells that fire together, wire together.” So trying to see yourself with any objectivity can be like trying to touch your right elbow with your right hand.\nBut if you can detach from yourself a little bit, you’ll notice that the things you do and think don’t just come out of nowhere. Here are a few techniques and tools you can use to better understand the way your past can interfere with your happiness, your relationships, and your life today.\nYou can work backward . . .\nAre you relentlessly driving yourself to succeed and beating yourself up when you fail? Maybe that’s because when you were a teenager, your parents made you feel as if your worth as a human being was dependent on your grades, touchdowns, or accomplishments.\nAre you out of touch with your emotions because Stepdad always told you to toughen up when you cried? Do you feel deep down like you don’t matter because you were often ignored growing up? Are you always trying to save or care for others because you were never able to save Mom from her depression or addiction? Are you in complete denial that anything was wrong with your family because Dad acted as if he were infallible and must be unquestioningly obeyed, so criticizing him would be like blaspheming God?\nAre you getting the hang of this yet?\nYou can excuse my language . .\nSome of you have a big bag of shit you’re carrying around. And every time you encounter a situation in which you can possibly get more shit to put in the bag, you grab it and stuff it inside. You’ll even ignore all the diamonds glittering nearby, because all you can see is the shit.\nThis shit is known as “the stories you tell yourself\".\nExamples include generalizations like “I make bad decisions,” “If people saw the real me, they wouldn’t like me,” or, conversely, “No one is good enough for me.” Each of these beliefs can be formed in childhood by, respectively, fault-finding parents, abandoning parents, and parents who put you on a pedestal.\nAs a result, you can spend much of your life misinterpreting situations and thinking you’ve found more evidence to support these false conclusions formed in childhood. One way to recognize when you’re stuck in your own story is whenever you feel less than or better than others.\nYou can examine this chart .\nWounded Child (emotionally 0–5) Adapted Adolescent (emotionally6–18) Functional Adult (emotionally mature) Worthless Arrogant Esteemed from Within Extremely Vulnerable Invulnerable Healthy Boundaries Extremely Needy Needless Communicates Needs Feels Bad/Naughty Feels Blameless/Perfect Honest and Self-Aware Out of Control Hypercontrolling Flexible and Moderate Fears Abandonment Fears Suffocation Interdependent Seeks Attention Seeks Intensity Lives in Integrity and Harmony Idealizes Caretakers/Partners Disillusioned by Caretakers/Partners In Reality About Caretakers/Partners Then ask yourself: In a given week, do you exhibit any of the wounded child or adolescent behaviors here? If so, you may have either gotten stuck somewhere along the way in your emotional or behavioral development, or certain situations are causing you to revert to those ages. Any time you overreact to something—by shutting down losing your temper, sulking, feeling hopeless, freaking out, disassociating, or any of numerous other dysfunctional behaviors—it’s typically because an old wound has been triggered. And you’re regressing to the childhood or adolescent state that corresponds to that feeling.\nNote that the wounded child tends to directly internalize the messages that caretakers give; the adapted adolescent tends to react against them.\nHowever, not everyone reacts to the same trauma in the same way . .\nAnd children are born with different predispositions and resiliencies.\nSo if you remain loyal to people who abuse and mistreat you, that’s called trauma bonding.\nIf you only feel normal if you’re doing something extreme or high-risk, that’s trauma arousal.\nIf you’ve developed intense self-loathing, you’ve got trauma shame.\nIf you find chemical, mental, or technological ways to numb yourself and your feelings, that’s trauma blocking.\nAnd it goes on and on. One pattern of trauma; many different possible responses to it. We’ve only scratched the surface. But at least you know the model we’re working with here\nIt’s not about blaming but understanding . . .\nIn summary, we each spend our adult lives running on a unique operating system that took some eighteen years to program and is full of distinct bugs and viruses. And when we put together all these different theories of attachment, developmental immaturity, post-traumatic stress, and internal family systems\nthey make up a body of knowledge that allows us to run a virus scan on ourselves and, at any point, to look at our behaviors, our thoughts, and our feelings, and figure out where they come from.\nThat’s the easy part. The tough part is to quarantine the virus, and to recognize the false self and restore the true self. Because it isn’t until we start developing an honest, compassionate, and\nfunctional relationship with ourselves that we can begin to experience a healthy, loving relationship with others\nAnd that,” Lorraine concludes, “is what chair work is all about.”\nBelieve, behave, become: Believe in you and Ingrid. Behave for Ingrid. Become a nuclear family\nthink of intimacy as into me I see and I share that with you—that’s intimacy\nIntimacy problems come from a lack of self-love\nSomeone who fears intimacy thinks\nunconsciously, If you knew who I actually was, you’d leave me.”\nYour wives may think they sent you here because you’re sick and they’re normal, but I’ve never worked with a couple\nwhere one of them had it all together and the other was a screw-up. They’ve got just as many issues as you do. Proof of this is the fact that they’re still with you.”\navoidant gives and gives, sacrificing his own needs, but it’s never enough for the love addict\nSo the avoidant grows resentful and seeks an outlet outside of the relationship, but at the same time feels too guilty to stop taking care of the needy person\ngetting\ncaught. And that shatters the fantasy for the love addict, who experiences her biggest nightmare: abandonment, which replicates her original wound\nThe pain and the fear are so intense for the love addict that she often develops her own secret life as well. Where the avoidant wants the highs, the addict typically goes for the lows. She wants benzodiazepines, alcohol, romance novels, shopping\ntill she drops, or anything that depresses the central nervous system. If she acts out sexually or has an emotional affair, it’s not for intensity, but to numb the pain and get away from the agonizing hurt. Soon, the relationship is no longer about love for either partner, but about escaping from reality\nA healthy relationship is when two individuated adults decide to have a relationship and that becomes a third entity. They nurture the relationship and the relationship nurtures them. But they’re not overly dependent or independent\nThey are interdependent, which means that they take care of\nthe majority of their needs and wants on their own, but when they can’t, they’re not afraid to ask their partner for help.\nOnly when our love for someone exceeds our need for them do we have a shot at a genuine relationship together\nReal intelligence is when your mind and your heart connect.\nThat’s when you see the truth so clearly and unmistakably that you don’t have to think about it\nfact, all thinking will do is lead you away from the truth and soon you’ll be back in your head, groping with a penlight in the dark again\nEvery word, every step, every action is irreversible. If we step in front of a moving car, if we sign a contract we haven’t read, if we betray the person we love, the best we can do is try to clean up the mess. But no matter how hard we scrub, the stain on reality will never come out. The word you just read can\nnever be unread\nWhat you’re doing is sexual hoarding.

And that is the more meaningful of the two.’”\nLove is something about a person, some connection with them, that makes you willing to change.”\nIt’s always been something that I felt my partner expected or made me do. If I treat it as a choice this time as opposed to a demand, then maybe I can be the Prodigal Boyfriend\nYou, my friend, are on a deadline to love right now. If you want any hope of being in a relationship with Ingrid again, you’re going to have to attack your trauma with all the commitment you have and every tool there is before that wedding\nOnly\nafter you’ve learned how to be alone without loneliness will you be ready for a relationship\nAs you peel away the layers of the false self, you’re going to start feeling the pain inside that it’s protecting you from. So you’re going to get very raw and uncomfortable before you get better\nif you can process all that old pain in an adult, healthy way this time, you won’t need your old walls and defenses anymore.”\nIf she doesn’t want you back and she’s the catalyst for this change, then she’s the best thing that ever happened to you\nforce feelings to surface so they can be examined, and to find the deeper causes for your behavior. In that respect, it’s working amazingly well. How you feel during the process is the least important part. So you can feel good to the extent that you’re doing the work to learn about yourself\nand you’re willing to look at the feelings that come up. That’s the part to hold on to\nI made a mistake by equating variety with freedom\nleaving all my options open has kept me too busy juggling them to really live\nStudies on choice even affirm that having too many options leads to less happiness and satisfaction.\nYou have your own internal therapist that is far wiser than any external\ntherapist you could consult. You just need to find that voice and listen to it.”\nI put the photo in a frame and place it next to my bed. And I vow that from this day forward, that child will be protected. He will be loved. He will be accepted. He will be trusted. And all this will be given unconditionally\nHe will not\nbe taught to hate and fear. He will not be criticized for failing to live up to unrealistic expectations. He will not be used as a Kleenex or aspirin for someone else’s feelings of loneliness, fear, depression, or anxiety.\nstart filling him—and me\nwith the things I needed but never had as a child. When I have a negative thought about myself, I gently replace it with a positive truth. When I make a mistake, I forgive myself. When I’m too thin-skinned or thick-skinned, I gently guide myself back into moderate reality. And when I regress, I silently soothe\nmyself as if teaching a child not to be afraid of the dark.\nI’m reparenting myself. It’s somewhat pathetic that at this age, I need to properly learn how to be an adult. But if the problems I have in relationships are the\nresult of developmental immaturities, then by nurturing these stunted parts of myself into a growth spurt, perhaps I’ll finally attain the happiness and stability that have eluded me through them all\nEach day, I try to take care of the six core needs Lorraine told me about: physical, by surfing and eating healthily; emotional, by allowing myself to experience and express feelings without being either hypercontrolling or out of control with them; social, by spending time with\nAdam, Calvin, Rick, and other\ngrowth-minded friends; intellectual, by reading literature, listening to lectures, starting a film discussion group, and, most importantly, simply listening more; and, most alien of all for me, spiritual, through transcendental meditation, which a friend of Rick’s teaches me.\nthe destructive self and the creative self: the you that damages your life and the lives of others, and the you that brings forth the best in yourself, is connected to others, and is in harmony with the world around you.\nDo you see now that the way you choose to live your life affects everything about it?\nA cheat here and there is not just a cheat here and there. It’s a break in the continuum of who you are and the person you are in the world.”\nWHY I CHEATED\n1. I didn’t communicate or keep boundaries with Ingrid, so I acted out due to fear of\nengulfment.\n2. I didn’t share my sexual preferences with Ingrid or give her space to share hers, so I acted out due to unfulfilled sexual desires.\nI blamed her for “not allowing me” to fuck other people, so I acted out due to a denial of personal responsibility for my behavior\nI had feelings of worthlessness and low\nself-esteem deep down, so I acted out for acceptance and validation\nI had no spirituality and a faulty intellectual paradigm, so I acted out because I believed we’re no different\nfrom any other animal and that’s what animals do, and the consequences don’t really matter to the universe\nI think you’re going to understand what I mean now when I tell you the secret to being faithful.”\nDon’t trade long-term happiness for short-term pleasure.\nThink of intimacy as a fire,” he continues. “The more logs you add to it, the bigger it gets. And the bigger it gets, the less you want to throw water on it.”\nMy problem before was that the bigger the fire\ngot, the more I wanted to throw water on it. I was so scared it would consume me\nwith ambivalence and fear, a living thing will die. So no one who truly loves and is loved can ever be in a cage.”\n1. No matter what the situation may be, the right course of action is always compassion and love.\n2. As long as at least one partner is in the adult functional at any given time, most—if not all—arguments can be avoided.\n3. Recognize when you are backsliding into a childish or adolescent behavior. Then pinpoint what old story is being triggered and tell yourself the truth of the situation. Let go of the lie.\nAccept what is\nWhat if . . . Today I will expunge those two words from my vocabulary and replace them with I will\n5. Instead of saying “I’m never going to cheat\nagain,” say, “Today, I’m not going to do that thing that makes me feel weak and shameful about myself again\nthe fantasy of other people is almost always better than the reality.\n6. You can’t have a relationship with someone hoping they’ll change. You have to be willing to commit to them as they are, with no expectations. And if they happen to choose to\nchange at some point along the way, then that’s just a bonus\n7. Communicate and maintain healthy\nboundaries. This means finding the proper balance of filtering and protecting your self, thoughts, feelings, time, and behaviors without either closing off behind walls, or becoming overwhelmed or overwhelming\n8. Ask yourself throughout the day, “What do I need to do in this moment to take care of\nmyself?” If you can be aware of what legitimate needs and wants you’re not attending to, and then take actions to meet them on your own—or ask your partner for help if you can’t—that is the road to happiness\nNo one can make you feel anything and you don’t make anyone feel a certain way. So don’t take on responsibility for your partner’s\nfeelings and don’t blame your partner for yours. The most caring thing to do when they’re upset is simply to ask if they want you to listen, to give advice, to give them space, or to give them loving touch\nLove, honor, and affirm yourself. Whatever your decisions, actions, feelings, and thoughts throughout the day may be and whatever outcome they may lead to, if you are healthy\nthen they are ultimately healthy\nIs it in my highest good?\nAnd, above all, always remember to breathe and be in the moment\nas psychiatrist Eric Berne puts it even more\nsuccinctly, “Love is nature’s psychotherapy\nI finally understand what the true intimacy that Joan spoke about in rehab actually is: It’s when partners stop living in the past—in their trauma history—and start\nhaving a relationship with each other in the present moment. Love, it turns out, is not something to be learned. It’s something we already have, and we must unlearn in order to access it\nI use the four adjustments to turn shame into reassurance.\nShame is about being bad for someone\nreassurance is about being good to yourself\nnot only does it make more sense to respond with compassion instead of criticism, it’s also much easier on everyone involved. It may be the key to a longer, happier life\nI always wanted more—more women, more success, more money, more space, more experience, more possessions. Not once did I stop and say, as I do now, “I have enough.\nIf they’re emotionally healthy adults, then there’s no dilemma that they\ncan’t work out together. They’re not going to even notice each other aging but just getting happier.\nMany of the concepts can be found in the works of\nPia Mellody, James Hollis, Virginia Satir, John Bradshaw, Kenneth Adams, Marshall Rosenberg, Marion Solomon, Harville Hendrix, Salvador Minuchin, Peter Levine, Bessel van der Kolk, Robert Firestone, and others. I also recommend taking Patrick Carnes’s Post-Traumatic Stress Index test\nonline to understand the ways your past haunts your behavior today. (Use the original PTSI test, not the revised PTSI-R.) And you may want to email Barbara McNally (the one in Venice, CA) and urge her to publish her own book, because her teachings and wisdom were a big influence as well.\nI’m currently keeping an open and expanding list of recommended websites, workshops, and practitioners at www.neilstrauss.com/thetruth\nI also have a detailed reading list there, as well as information on trauma-healing workshops that offer\nscholarships for those who don’t have book advances to spend.\nwww.neilstrauss.com/goodtimes\nThe best thing we can do for our relationships with\nothers . . . is to render our relationship to\nourselves\nmore conscious. This is not a narcissistic activity. In fact,\nit will prove to be the most loving thing we can do for\nthe Other. The greatest gift to others is our\nown best selves.\nThus, paradoxically, if we are to serve relationship well,\nwe are obliged to affirm our individual journey",

Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable.

If you are trying to get a job as a Network Engineer, you will want to check this out.\nI went through dozens of job listings that mentioned CCNA. Then, tallied up the main devices/vendors, certifications, and technologies mentioned. And left out anything that wasn’t mentioned more than twice.\nCore CCNA technologies such as LAN, WAN, OSPF, Spanning Tree, VLANs, etc. have been left out. The point here is to target the most sought after technologies and skills by employers. I also left out soft skills and any job that wasn’t a networking specific role.\nDevices/ Vendors Palo Alto is huge! I’m not suprised by this. Depending on the company, a network engineer may be responsible for firewall configuration and troubleshooting. It also looks like Network Engineers with a wide variety of skills are saught after.\nDevice/Vendor Times Mentioned Palo Alto 9 Cisco ASA 6 Juniper 6 Office 365 5 Meraki 4 Vmware 4 Linux 4 Ansible 4 AWS 3 Wireshark 3 Technologies Firewall comes in first again. Followed closely by VPN skills. Every interview I had for a Network Engineer position asked if I knew how to configure and troubleshoot VPNs.\nTechnology Times Mentioned Firewall 19 VPN 16 Wireless 12 BGP 12 Security 12 MPLS 10 Load balancers 8 Ipsec 7 ISE 6 DNS 5 SDWAN 5 Cloud 4 TACACS+ 4 ACL 4 SIEM 4 IDS/IPS 4 RADIUS 3 ITIL 3 Ipam 3 VOIP 3 EIGRP 3 Python 3 Certifications CCNP blew every other cert out of the water. Companies will be very interested if you are working towards this cert. Security + comes highly recommended as well.\nCertification Times Mentioned CCNP 18 Security+ 6 JNCIA 4 JNCIP 4 Network + 4 CCIE 4 PCNSA 3 So what do you do after CCNA? It depends…\nAre you trying to get a new job ASAP? Are there opportunities at your current role that you can use your new skills to leverage? Do you have some study time before you are ready to take the next step?\nCCNP Enterprise is a good bet if you really want to stand out in Network Engineering interviews.\nDon’t want to be a Network engineer? Continue to build a good base of IT skills. This will open you up to a larger variety of jobs and open skill paths that you need a good foundation to unlock.\nCore skills include:\nLinux/ Operating systems Networking General Cybersecurity Programming/ Scripting A good Linux certification like the RHCSA would be great to learn more about Linux, scripting, and operating systems. Security + would be good if you want to get a solid foundation of cyber security. And Python skills will give you a gold star in any IT interview.\nDon’t get paralyzed by choices. Pick something that interests you and go for it. That is the only way to get it right. Doing what you enjoy is better than not doing anything at all because you can’t decide the best path.\nHopefully we can revisit this post after learning Python to get a much bigger sample size.",

    "content": "Excellent primer on how addiction wires your brain. Explains the negatives of porn use without going into anything religious. Also gives tips on quitting porn use and includes many anecdotes of people describing how their lives changed when giving up porn use.\nSummary and Highlights Sexual desire is one of our most powerful motivational forces, and has been essential to the flourishing of the human race. Yet pornography transforms that drive into a force that primarily motivates the completely solitary and unproductive activity of masturbation.\nThe more that people’s reward systems are tuned to forming social connections with others, the more likely they are to be both more physically healthy and more psychologically well balanced.\n“I count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who conquers his enemies; for the hardest victory is over self.” -Aristotle\nPsychiatrist Norman Doidge explains in his bestseller “The Brain That Changes Itself”:\nThis is how chronic overconsumption can have unexpected effects. It can make us hyper-aroused by our favourite enticements, such that immediate wants weigh heavier than they should relative to longer term desires. It can also sour our enjoyment of – and responsiveness to – everyday pleasures. It can drive us to seek more extreme stimulation. Or cause withdrawal symptoms so severe that they send even the most strong-minded of us bolting for relief.\nIt can also alter our mood, perception and priorities – all without our conscious awareness.\nHarry Fisch book “The New Naked” correlates with reduced grey matter and decreased sexual responsiveness.\nMost users regard internet porn as a solution – to boredom, sexual frustration, loneliness or stress.\nBesides normal libido they started reporting other positive changes too:\nDepression and social anxiety going away. Increased confidence. The feeling of fulfilment. Being on top of the world. Studies on appetite show that variety is strongly associated with overconsumption.\nIrritability, fatigue, inability to sleep (even sleep aids don’t help much), trembling/shaking, lack of focus, shortness of breath, and depression.\nIf you don’t realize such symptoms are connected with quitting, but you do notice that returning to porn relieves them, then you are strongly motivated to keep using porn.\nExisting studies do find that frequency of porn viewing correlates with depression, anxiety, stress and social (mal)functioning, as well as less sexual and relationship satisfaction and altered sexual tastes.\nPoorer quality of life and health, and real-life intimacy problems.\nImpaired motivation and confidence, brain fog (inability to focus), loss of attraction to real people, sexual dysfunction, escalation to what users themselves describe as more extreme material over time, and so forth.\nImprovements since quitting:\nSocial anxiety improved drastically. Confidence, eye contact, comfort interacting, smoothness, etc. More energy in general. Clearer, sharper mind, more concentration. More vibrant looking face. Depression alleviated. Desire to interact with women. Boners are back!! justified it in my head by saying it was ‘healthy for me’ and ‘at least it isn’t a drug.‘\nAny of the following may precede or accompany delayed ejaculation and erectile dysfunction:\nEarlier genres of porn are no longer exciting. Uncharacteristic fetishes develop. Porn use is more sexually exciting than a partner. Sensitivity of penis decreases. Sexual arousal with sexual partners declines. Erections fade when attempting penetration or shortly thereafter. Penetrative sex is not stimulating. Porn fantasy is necessary to maintain erection or interest with partner. A few men bounce back in a relatively short time: about 2-3 weeks.\nThe vast majority of guys need 2-6 months (or longer) to fully recover.\nMasturbation/porn can cause PE especially when you start doing it young. You want to reach climax/orgasm quickly because of the fear of being caught. So you teach your mind that when you’re hard your job is to cum quickly and not enjoy the interim sensation.\nMy mechanistic porn habits have taken away all sensuality from the act of orgasm, turning it into a short spurt and muscle memory twitch of a climax.\nTolerance, which is an addiction process that drives a need for greater and greater stimulation.\nWhen scientists jacked up pair-bonding animals on amphetamine, the naturally monogamous animals no longer formed a preference for one partner.\nToo much stimulation weakens pair bonds.\nSocial anxiety, self-esteem. As users manage to abstain from porn, their desire to connect with others generally surges.\nOften, so does their self-esteem, their ability to look others in the eye, their sense of humour, their optimism, their attractiveness to potential mates, and so forth.\n“The Brain That Changes Itself” -Norman Doidge\nFemales are complimenting me on my looks and body. My awareness around social situations is much better. I can read people’s body language better. People cannot intimidate me as before.\nI feel that their anger just bounces off me, and I stay in a serene state.\nHave ‘better concentration’, ‘no more brain fog’, ‘clearer thinking’ and ‘improved memory‘.\nAddiction neuroscientists have repeatedly shown that internet addiction produces memory, concentration and impulse-control problems in some users, as well as corresponding brain changes.\nMy mind became very clear, thoughts easily controllable, and I became much more relaxed in general.\nI can retain and remember information a lot better. I remember events in my past life a lot better.\nI am not irritable, and am more focused. I can execute tasks a lot faster.\nI finally have energy again!\nWhen I look in the mirror I feel like my skin has a glow to it.\nQuitting isn’t a cure all for your life problems – but it’s the foundation, a ploughed field in which you can sow seeds for a new future that isn’t bedevilled by the secrecy and shame that comes with falling into the seemingly inescapable pit of porn-related despair that so many of us know.\nA life of hope and strength, not jizzy tissues, jealousy, bitterness, self-hatred, resentment and unfulfilled dreams.\nYou wire your sexual excitement to a screen.\nUnconscious sexual conditioning can be summed up as, ‘This is what turns me on’ or, at a brain level, ‘This is what jacks up my dopamine’.\nThis neurochemical reality primes young brains. They learn to define sex according to whatever stimuli offer the biggest sexual buzz.\nOnce new connections form, teen brains hold tightly to these associations.\nOur most powerful and lasting memories arise from adolescence – along with our worst habits.\nMethamphetamine and cocaine hijack the same reward-centre nerve cells that evolved for sexual conditioning.\nStandard addiction assessment test known as the ‘Three Cs’.\nCraving and preoccupation with obtaining, engaging in or recovering from the use of the substance or behavior;\nLoss of control in using the substance or engaging in the behavior with increasing frequency or duration.\nLarger amounts or intensity, or in increasing the risk in use and behavior to obtain the desired effect; and negative consequences in physical, social, occupational, financial and psychological domains.\nDutch researchers found that online erotica has the highest addictive potential of all online applications (with online gaming second).\nHigher hours per week/more years of porn viewing correlated with a reduction in grey matter in sections of the reward circuitry (striatum) involved in motivation and decision-making.\nReduced grey matter in this reward-related region means fewer nerve connections.\nFewer nerve connections here translates into sluggish reward activity, or a numbed pleasure response, often called desensitisation.\nImpaired impulse control.\nIntense exposure to pornographic stimuli results in a downregulation of the natural.\nBoth hyper-reactivity to addiction cues (hardcore video) and reduced sexual responsiveness to tamer sexual visuals are not surprising in porn overconsumers.\nAll addiction is one condition.\nBehavioural and substance addiction confirm that all addictions modify the same fundamental brain mechanisms and produce a recognized set of anatomical and chemical alterations.\nHere are some brain changes that show up in all addictions, whether substance or behavioural:\nDesensitisation, or a numbed response to pleasure. Reduced dopamine signalling and other changes leave the addict less sensitive to everyday pleasures and ‘hungry’ for dopamine-raising activities and substances.\nSensitisation, or an unconscious super-memory of pleasure that, when activated triggers powerful cravings.\nRewired nerve connections cause the reward circuit to buzz in response to addiction related cues or thoughts.\nHypofrontality or reduced brain activity in the prefrontal regions, which weakens willpower in the face of strong subconscious cravings.\nAlterations in the prefrontal region’s grey matter and white matter correlate with reduced impulse control and the weakened ability to foresee consequences.\nHypofrontality shows up as the feeling that two parts of your brain are engaged in a tug-of-war.\nDysfunctional stress circuits, which can make even minor stress lead to cravings and relapse because they activate powerful sensitized pathways.\nThese phenomena are at the core of all addictions.\nEx-porn users regularly report withdrawal symptoms that are reminiscent of drug withdrawals.\nInsomnia, anxiety, irritability, mood swings, headaches, restlessness, fatigue, poor concentration, depression, social paralysis and cravings.\nShaking, flu-like symptoms, muscle cramps or the mysterious sudden loss of libido that guys call the flatline.\nNot everyone who stops using pornography will suffer withdrawal symptoms, but some do.\nThe brain’s reward centre doesn’t know what porn is. It only registers levels of stimulation through dopamine spikes.\nDopamine is odd. It shoots up when something is better than expected (violates expectations), but drops when expectations are not met.\nWith sex, it’s nearly impossible to match internet porn's level of surprise variety and novelty.\nOnce a young man thoroughly conditions himself to porn, sex may not meet his unconscious expectations. Unmet expectations produce a drop in dopamine – and erections.\nAdolescents are especially vulnerable here because their reward circuitry is in overdrive.\nOver-sensitivity to reward also means its owner is more vulnerable to addiction.\nA natural sculpting process narrows a teen’s choices by adulthood. His brain prunes his neural circuitry to leave him with well-honed responses to life.\nResearch reveals that erections require adequate dopamine in the reward circuit and the male sexual centres of the brain.\nA decline in dopamine signalling is associated with all of these:\nDiminished sexual behaviour, which, as noted, is a possible cause of sluggish erections/climaxes. Decreased risk-taking and increased anxiety, combined with a tendency toward angry overreaction, any of which can decrease willingness to socialize. Inability to focus, which can account for concentration and memory problems. Lack of motivation and healthy anticipation, which can lead to apathy procrastination, and even play a role in depression. Instead of acting on impulse, you’ll be learning self-restraint and mindfulness with one of your most primal instincts.\nWhich will flow over into every part of your life and make your life’s decisions be entirely up to you.\nWhen I started this 500 days ago, I had trouble concentrating; I couldn’t commit to a goal for more than a week at a time. Whenever I had a day off I wasted it in lazy indulgence.\nKnowing that I could be doing more with my time. Now, I can handle 50, 60 hour work weeks regularly without even noticing it.\nNow, I can exercise regularly and stick to it. Now, I’m in a relationship unlike any I’ve ever been in because I can finally treat my partner as another human being rather than sometimes as an object of desire.\nNow, I’m constantly improving myself instead of just wishing I could.\nRestore the sensitivity of your brain’s reward circuitry so you can again enjoy everyday pleasures.\nReduce the intensity of the ‘gotta have it!’ brain pathways that drive you to use.\nre-establish your willpower (strengthen the brain’s frontal lobes). reduce the impact of stress such that it doesn’t set off severe cravings. The problematic behaviors and symptoms of porn addiction are material in nature. They are inscribed in the structures of the brain. By changing behavior we change those structures.\nOver time new ways of life are reflected in changes in brain function.\nArtificial sexual stimulation includes anything your brain might use in the way it has been using porn: cam2cam erotic encounters, sexting, reading erotica, friendfinder apps, fantasizing about porn scenarios.\nConsistently refuse to activate the porn pathways in your brain.\nFreedom lies in allowing it to return to normal sensitivity and weaken any addiction pathways. Only then will you be truly free to set your own priorities without loud neurochemical signals stressing you and overriding your choices.\nTips I see on the recovery forums:\nDelete all porn from your devices this action sends your brain the signal that your intention to change is ironclad.\nMove your furniture around. Environmental cues associated with use can be powerful triggers because they themselves release dopamine.\nAvoid friends, neighborhoods, and activities associated with previous use.\nConsider using your online devices only in a less private location, which you don’t associate with porn use. Or transform your ‘porn space’ environment. Get rid of your ‘masturbation chair’ or simply move your furniture around.\nConsider a porn blocker and an ad blocker.\nPorn blockers are not fail-proof. They are like speed-bumps. They give you time to realize that you’re about to do what you really don’t want to do.\nFree porn blockers are available at these sites:\nQustodio - http://www.qustodio.com/index2 K-9 – http://www1.k9webprotection.com Esafely.com – http://www.esafely.com/home.php OpenDNS – http://www.opendns.com/home-internet-security/parental-controls/ Block all sexual categories, all dating categories and all blog categories.\nConsider using an ad blocker. That way you won’t have to see wiggling images in your sidebar when making holiday plans or ordering vitamins.\n‘AdblockPlus’ is free.\nConsider a day-counter.\nWhat matters is not days but brain balance. Brains do not all return to balance on a set schedule.\nAnd while brains definitely need time to reboot, accumulated days aren’t the whole story.\nBrain balance also benefits from exercise, socializing, time in nature, increased self-control, better self-care and so forth.\nAn alternative to setting a long day-count goal is to set mini-goals for yourself\nExtinction training\nCue extinction. You weaken the link or pathway between a stimulus and a habitual response\nIf extinction training (sometimes known as Exposure Response Prevention Therapy) is too risky for you because glimpses of porn sites throw you into a binge, try an indirect approach to strengthening your willpower first (or any beneficial stressor) and meditation are good choices.\nSupport\nJoin a forum, get an accountability partner.\nInvolvement in an online community where others are experimenting with giving up porn is helpful for most people. It can inspire you give you a place to rant, supply the good feelings that come from supporting others, and generate new tips for speeding your progress.\nSaid one guy:\nSites such as NoFap.org and Reboot Nation facilitate finding accountability partners.\nTherapy, support groups, healthcare.\nKeep a journal\nThere are good days and bad days, and on the bad days your brain will try to persuade you that you have made no progress and there is no hope that you ever will.\nOften by reading earlier entries from your journal you can swiftly put things back in perspective.\nManaging Stress, Improving Self-control and Self-care.\nExercise, beneficial stressors\nExercise seems to be the most universally beneficial distraction from urges, also improves self-confidence and fitness, and is even associated with better erectile function in men under 40.\nExercise is a solid mood regulator.\nCan help ease addiction because acute bouts of exercise increase dopamine concentrations, and regular exercise leads to sustained increases in dopamine and related adjustments.\nThis helps counteract the chronically low dopamine signalling that haunts recovering addicts before their brains reboot.\nVisit www.gettingstronger.org for articles and research about the physiology behind exercise, intermittent fasting, daily cold showers, and so forth.\nGet outside\nTime in nature is good for the brain. It boosts creativity, insight and problem solving.\nGet outside into the natural light and breathe fresh air. We weren’t meant to look at glowing rectangles and breathe recycled air 24/7.\nSocializing\nHumans evolved as tribal, pair-bonding primates. Our brains cannot easily regulate mood on their own, at least not for long.\nIt’s not unusual to feel anxious or depressed (or self-medicate with an addiction) when isolated.\nWhen recovering users force their attention away from their habitual ‘relief’, their reward circuitry looks around for other sources of pleasure.\nEventually it finds the natural rewards it evolved to find: friendly interaction, real mates, time in nature, exercise, accomplishment, creativity, and so forth.\nAll ease cravings.\nMeditation, relaxation techniques\nDaily meditation helps the rational part of the brain, called the frontal lobes, to stay in the driver’s seat.\nMeditation thus strengthens what addiction has weakened.\nEven as it quiets the primitive parts of the brain that drive impulsive behavior.\nCreative pursuits, hobbies, life purpose\nPut all your extra time, energy and confidence to use on other efforts that keep you preoccupied.\nCreativity is both a great distraction and inherently rewarding because of the anticipation of achieving something important to you:\nLimit activities that cause 'empty' dopamine highs, such as frequent, intense videogaming, junk food, gambling, trolling Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter and Yahoo, meaningless TV, and so forth.\nInstead, steer for activities that produce more lasting, sustainable satisfaction even if they aren’t as rewarding in the short-run:\nHaving a good conversation, organizing your work space, receiving/giving a therapeutic massage, goal-setting, visiting someone, building something or gardening.\nAttitude, Education and Inspiration\nBe gentle with yourself.\nYou don’t let that urge go anywhere. You say ‘no’, that one time, and you do that every one time that it comes up. That's it. Not X days of constant willpower, just a subtle lifestyle change, a quiet ‘no’ whenever the random desire flickers up and tries to take hold.\nCommon withdrawal symptoms include: irritability, anxiety or even panic, unaccustomed tears, restlessness, lethargy, headaches, brain fog, depression, mood swings, desire to isolate, muscle tightness, insomnia, and severe cravings to use porn.\nInsomnia\nIt’s important to stay well rested as fatigue can trigger porn use.\nTriggers\nOne man described triggers as, ‘the external factors that make you think about porn.’\nCommon triggers include: TV shows and movies with erotic content, porn flashbacks, morning wood, use of recreational drugs or alcohol.\nWords that remind you of a porn site/actor and suggestive ads.\nStates of mind can also be triggers: boredom, anxiety, stress, depression, loneliness, rejection, fatigue, frustration, anger, failure, feeling sorry for yourself, desire to reward yourself for an accomplishment, overconfidence, jealousy, and being hung-over.\nKeep a list of things you want to accomplish as well as a list of risk-free activities for those moments when you just don’t have the motivation to do something productive.\nEmotions\nPeople who quit porn often remark that they feel more emotions. Why is this a challenge?\nBecause unfamiliar emotions can be overwhelming at first, especially if they are unwelcome.\nChaser\nThe term ‘chaser’ is often used to describe intense cravings that sometimes follow orgasm.\nDisturbing dreams, flashbacks\nPeople often remark that they recall their dreams better after quitting.\nThey register as hyper-arousing, which means they also offer temporary comforting oblivion when feelings of shame strike. This explains how some users fall into a ‘shame-binge shame’ cycle.\nThe key seems to be to channel lots of energy into constructive action and self-compassion and away from excruciating, yet arousing, inner battles.\nCommon Pitfalls Edging\nSometimes persuade themselves that ejaculation is the main problem and internet porn is secondary.\nIn men, edging stresses the prostate.\nDopamine is at its peak when on the verge of orgasm.\nAt orgasm, prolactin rises, which drops dopamine to baseline levels and inhibits its release.\nThat normally spells some relief for sexual frustration.\nPlacing your foot on the dopamine gas, without ever hitting the brake (prolactin) results in a continuous state of cravings without satisfaction.\nOnce he stopped viewing porn, the urge to masturbate eased a lot, because without porn, masturbation was not that interesting.\nFantasizing\nResearch on mental imagery indicates that fantasizing or imagining an experience activates many of the same neural circuits as performing it.\nYour brain doesn’t make a distinction between imagery that comes from a computer screen or inside your own mind, so running porn-like imagery through your brain is little different from watching porn.\nAnother type of fantasy that involves intimacy but not sex. These fantasies involve things like exchanging smiles, holding hands, giving back or foot massages.\nUsing porn substitutes\nThe primitive part of your brain doesn’t know what porn is. It simply knows whether something is arousing (to you) or not.\nInternet porn addiction is not an addiction to naked or erotic; it’s an addiction to novelty.\nAssuming a fetish is permanent\nThe fact is, only by process of elimination will you know whether you are dealing with a porn-induced superficial fetish or a true fetish arising from the core of your sexual identity.\nAll erotic memories gain power, and are reinforced with each instance of arousal.\nPorn fetishes often turn out to be superficial. Again, many who quit porn (and porn-inspired fantasy) for a few months see their extreme tastes dissipate.\nThe bad urge\nThe ideal time to deal with a bad urge is before it shows up.\nNot being at home, or a place where you usually fap, will be incredibly helpful in getting past the first few days of withdrawal throes.\nMake a list (now) of reasons you are avoiding porn and consult it when The Urge arises.\nIf you don’t know what else to do you can always wait and do nothing.\nThink to yourself, ‘Here are cravings. They came out of nowhere and they have no real power over me. I am not my thoughts; I did not summon them. I do not want them; and I do not have to act on them.’\nAll urges die down eventually, usually within quarter of an hour.\nDon’t discuss the situation with your brain. Your brain will try to rationalize porn use because it desperately wants it. The key here is not to argue with your own brain, but instead to simply acknowledge that you’re having the thought, or to answer with one word: ‘No‘\nSelf-determination requires that we understand ourselves as best we can.\nBurnham, Terry and Phelan, Jay, Mean Genes: From Sex to Money to Food Taming Our Primal Instincts, New York: Basic Books, 2000.\nFunny, informative book about how the reward circuitry of the brain drives us to do things that are not always in our best interests.",
    "description": "Excellent primer on how addiction wires your brain. Explains the negatives of porn use without going into anything religious. Also gives tips on quitting porn use and includes many anecdotes of people describing how their lives changed when giving up porn use.\nSummary and Highlights Sexual desire is one of our most powerful motivational forces, and has been essential to the flourishing of the human race. Yet pornography transforms that drive into a force that primarily motivates the completely solitary and unproductive activity of masturbation.",
