    <description>We are sick of manually setting up virtual machines and configuring them. You can use Ansible to automate the configuration of a server. But what about setting up a server before it’s configured? Let’s stop doing that manually as well by using Vagrant.&#xA;Also, by setting up your infrastructure as code, you get to set up machines quickly and consistently manage and deploy your servers. This reduces the time it takes, operating costs, and minimizes the chance of configuration errors.</description>
