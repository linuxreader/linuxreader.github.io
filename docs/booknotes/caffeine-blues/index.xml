    <title>Caffeine Blues (9/10) :: Linux Reader</title>
    <link>http://linuxreader.com/booknotes/caffeine-blues/</link>
    <description>Everyone should read this book. Caffeine does more than just block adenosine receptors so you donâ€™t feel tired. Caffeine = Stress. Would have given it a 10/10 but there is some stuff about supplements that I do not agree with. I tried all of the supplements and they had their own side effects. I am also not able to look at the studies listed so a more modern approach with links would be nice. I have read this 4 times.</description>
