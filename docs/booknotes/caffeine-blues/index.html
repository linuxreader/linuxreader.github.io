<p>Everyone should read this book. Caffeine does more than just block adenosine receptors so you don&rsquo;t feel tired. Caffeine = Stress. Would have given it a 10/10 but there is some stuff about supplements that I do not agree with. I tried all of the supplements and they had their own side effects. I am also not able to look at the studies listed so a more modern approach with links would be nice. I have read this 4 times.</p>

<h2 id="summary-and-highlights">Summary and Highlights</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Caffeine can’t provide energy, only chemical stimulation, an induced emergency state that can lead to irritability, mood swings, and panic attacks.</p>
<p>Caffeine’s ultimate mood effect can be letdown, which can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.</p>
<p>Caffeine gives the illusion of heightened alertness by dilating pupils, quickening heart rate, and raising blood pressure. In fact, caffeine does not increase overall mental activity.</p>
<p>The drug contributes to palpitations, panic attacks, hypoglycemia, gastritis, fatigue, insomnia, and PMS, to name a few.</p>
<p>Contributes to adrenal exhaustion.</p>
<p>Raises blood cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Caffeine also raises blood pressure, increases homocysteine (a biochemical that damages artery walls), promotes arrhythmias, and
constricts blood vessels leading to the heart.</p>
<p><em>Caffeine gives you energy</em>. Wrong. Caffeine does not provide energy—only chemical stimulation. The perceived “energy” comes from
the body’s struggle to adapt to increased blood levels of stress hormones.</p>
<p>Role in depression and anxiety</p>
<p>Positively linked to panic attacks,</p>
<p>Users may feel more alert, the experience is simply one of increased sensory and motor activity (dilated pupils, increased heart rate, and
higher blood pressure). The quality of thought and recall is improved no more than the quality of music is improved when played at a higher volume or speed.</p>
<p>Caffeine actually <em>decreases</em> overall mental acuity.</p>
<p>Women are at higher risk than men, and children are the most vulnerable to caffeine because of their limited ability to detoxify
the drug.</p>
<p>Peak consumption periods at three, thirteen, and seventeen. These children are set up for a lifetime addiction with serious health
consequences.</p>
<p>Caffeine’s connection to hyperactivity, learning and behavior disorders, fatigue, cancer, heart disease, ulcers, headache, allergy,
PMS, birth defects, and more.</p>
<p>Many of our physical experiences of tension and pain are directly related to the level of stress hormones in our bodies.</p>
<p>Caffeine acts as a pain trigger because it elevates blood levels of these biochemicals.</p>
<p>No scientist can tell you how much caffeine is safe for you to ingest because the effects of caffeine differ significantly from person to person.</p>
<p>What is tolerable for one person may be excessive for another. Moreover, what is tolerable caffeine intake at one point in your life may actually cause health problems just a few years later.</p>
<p>I suggest that you try kicking the habit for sixty days—the minimum amount of time you’ll need to evaluate the benefits of a caffeine-free body and mind.</p>
<h3 id="coffee-and-caffeine-a-dose-of-reality">Coffee and Caffeine: A Dose of Reality</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We have seen several well-marked cases of coffee excess. … The sufferer is tremulous, and loses his self-command; he is subject to
fits of agitation and depression; he loses color and has a haggard appearance. The apatite falls off, and symptoms of gastric catarrh may
be manifested. The heart also suffers; it palpitates, or it intermits. As with other such agents, a renewed dose of the poison gives
temporary relief, but at the cost of future misery. … By miseries such as these, the best years of life may be spoilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>—SIR T. CLIFFORD ALLBUTT and   DR. WALTER ERNEST DIXON in <em>A System of Medicine</em>, vol. II, London,
1909</p>
<p>Robusta beans contain nearly twice the caffeine of arabica and are also more acidic. Mass-marketed brands of coffee contain primarily
robusta, whereas specialty coffees tend to be made primarily from arabica beans.</p>
<p>Supplying worldwide demand requires an incredible amount of space.</p>
<p>If predators persist in eating a caffeine-containing plant, the caffeine can cause central nervous system disruptions and even lethal
side effects. Most pests soon learn to leave the plant alone.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that it may take up to <em>seven days</em> to decaffeinate the blood of habitual coffee drinkers.4 Plus, it can take three weeks
or more for the body’s levels of stress hormones to return to normal. If that’s not accumulation, what is?</p>
<p>It is also important to look at the chain of biochemical and behavioral events that caffeine creates, not just the immediate
effects.</p>
<h3 id="are-you-addicted">Are You Addicted?</h3>
<p>Of all my recommendations—including weight loss, dietary change, exercise, and stress management—no single factor matched the impact of caffeine reduction.</p>
<p>“Caffeinism” is a state of chronic toxicity resulting from excess caffeine consumption. Caffeinism usually combines physical addiction
with a wide range of debilitating effects, most notably anxiety, irritability, mood swings, sleep disturbance, depression, and fatigue.</p>
<p>If your total is between 100 and 300 milligrams per day, you’re in the “danger zone.” Disruption of sleep patterns begins at this level, and
certain heart disease risk factors may be increased.</p>
<p>• If your total is 300 to 600 milligrams per day, you are undoubtedly experiencing some degree of mental and physical addiction to caffeine. Research shows an almost 200 percent increase of risk for ulcers and fibrocystic disease at this level.</p>
<p>• Intake of 600 to 900 milligrams per day indicates almost certain addiction. At this level, your mood and energy levels are severely
affected. Research suggests that your risk of heart attack may be twice that of non-caffeine users. If you are a pre-menopausal woman,
your chance of maintaining optimal iron levels is slim.</p>
<p>• At 900 milligrams or more per day, you’re a caffeine addict—hook, line, and sinker. At this level of dependency, all heart disease risk
factors are significantly increased, as are the risks for stroke, psychological disorders, and gastrointestinal disease. You may need medical help to kick the habit.</p>
<p>1. Energy swings or periods of fatigue during the
day
2. Mood swings or periods of depression during
the day
3. Headaches
4. Gastrointestinal distress; cramping, diarrhea
5. Constipation and/or dependence on caffeine for bowel
movement
6. Stifness in your neck, shoulders, jaw, hands, legs, or stomach
7. Premenstrual syndrome; menstrual irregularity, cramps, sore
breasts
8. Painful/sensitive lumps in the breast
9. Insomnia
10. Clenching the jaw or grinding teeth during sleep
11. Anxiety
12. Irritability, including inappropriate fits” of anger
13. Involuntary movement in the leg (restless leg syndrome)
14. Irregular or rapid heartbeat
15. Light-headedness/dizziness
16.Wake up feeling tired
17. Generalized pain (back
pain, stomach pain, muscle aches)
18. High blood pressure
19. Ulcers
20. Anemia
21. Shortness of breath
22. Difficulty concentrating and/or memory loss
23. Ringing in the ears
24. Coldness in the extremities, especially fingertips
25. Hand tremor</p>
<p>Caffeine has been found to impair motor steadiness in neuropsychological tests.</p>
<p>TMJD affects millions of Americans, contributes to headache and a raft of other disorders, and is positively associated with stress and
caffeine intake.</p>
<p>Teeth clenching and grinding (bruxism) at night are also related to stress and caffeine.</p>
<h4 id="withdrawal">WITHDRAWAL</h4>
<p>Reducing the dose or stopping the drug altogether produces well-defined symptoms, which may include:</p>
<p>• Headache
• Depression
• Profound fatigue
• Irritability
• Disorientation
• Increased muscle tension
• Nausea
• Vomiting</p>
<h4 id="dependence">DEPENDENCE</h4>
<p>Despite knowledge of a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by caffeine.</p>
<h4 id="inability-to-quit">INABILITY TO QUIT</h4>
<p>This was defined as a “persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use”.</p>
<p>Caffeine doesn’t give you energy—<em>it creates tension</em>, and the ultimate result of tension is always fatigue.</p>
<p>Total health also requires emotional stability, peace of mind, and an optimistic attitude. The effects of caffeine diminish these qualities.
Relationships with friends, partners, and co-workers depend on harmony, which is destroyed by anxiety, irritability, and tension.</p>
<p>Caffeine not only intensifies the stress in our lives, but makes us less able to cope.</p>
<h3 id="caffeine-and-your-body">Caffeine and Your Body</h3>
<p>Nearly 90 percent of American adults drink caffeinated beverages. This includes the scientists who explore caffeine’s effects and the
journalists who report the scientists’ findings.</p>
<p>Increasing their risk for heart disease, osteoporosis, anemia, PMS, panic attacks, and fibro-cystic breast disease.</p>
<p>The half-life of a single dose of caffeine can range from three to twelve hours.</p>
<p>Damage being done to your adrenals, blood vessels, breasts, brain, gastrointestinal tract, DNA, immune system, and bones.</p>
<p>Caffeine is rapidly absorbed by every organ and tissue in the body and diffuses into body fluids, including saliva, semen, breast milk, and
amniotic fluid. Caffeine goes everywhere and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Only then does the liver begin the task of reducing this troublesome toxin, and it’s not easy.</p>
<p>Usually, drug detoxification is a job shared by the liver and kidneys. The kidneys remove what they can and excrete it in the urine. Not so
with caffeine. The kidneys try to get rid of the molecule, but it is reabsorbed into the bloodstream before it reaches the urinary tract. Thus, the burden falls entirely on the liver.</p>
<p>Caffeine alone is broken down into more than twenty-five by-products or metabolites, the primary ones being paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. Interestingly, each of these metabolites has its own biochemistry and effect on the body.</p>
<p>Caffeine and its breakdown products (collectively called methylxanthines) have a number of effects on the body.</p>
<p>First, they disrupt the normal function of adenosine receptors.</p>
<p>Adenosine dampens or slows down neuron firing. It acts like a fuse box to prevent your circuits from getting overloaded. When caffeine
inactivates this control mechanism, your neuron circuits keep firing, and you feel alert. The problem is, your circuits keep firing, and firing, and firing.…</p>
<p>Uncontrolled neuron firing creates an emergency situation, which triggers the pituitary gland in the brain to secrete ACTH
(adrenocorticotrophic hormone). ACTH tells the adrenal glands to pump out stress hormones—the next major side effect of caffeine. A single 250-milligram dose of caffeine (the equivalent of about <em>21/2</em> six-ounce cups of coffee) has been shown to increase levels of the
stress hormone epi-nephrine (commonly known as adrenaline) by more than 200 percent.</p>
<p>Caffeine also stimulates the production of norepinephrine, another stress hormone that acts directly on the brain and nervous system. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are responsible for increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and that “emergency” feeling. In fact, the emergency is quite real.</p>
<p>Caffeine can trigger a classic fight-or-flight stress reaction.</p>
<p>There is one factor that tips the balance toward panic, and that is caffeine. It lowers the stress threshold so that events we would
normally handle suddenly become insurmountable. Not only that, you will soon see that caffeine reduces the brain’s problem-solving
ability.</p>
<p>As part of the ancient survival response, stress stimulates neuron activity in the primitive part of the brain known as the limbic
system. However, the vast majority of problems we face today require reason, imagination, and creativity: all functions of the “higher
brain” or cerebrum.</p>
<p>The sugar and fat that are dumped into your bloodstream go unused. The sugar creates additional metabolic stress, and the fat clogs your arteries.</p>
<p>And since blood flow has been diverted from the gastrointestinal tract, the food you just ate is converted to a fermenting and
putrefying mass.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a major contributor to the bloating, pain, and gas that roughly 50 percent of American adults experience after they eat.</p>
<p>Unseen are the harmful by-products of fermentation and putrefaction.</p>
<p>Some of these by-products are absorbed back into the bloodstream, and the toxins that stay in the gut increase your risk of gastrointestinal disease.</p>
<p>There’s no reason to digest your breakfast if you are about to become lunch.… [Under stress] a whole series of maintenance and repair
activities just stop.</p>
<p>Another part of the stress response known as vascular resistance, in which peripheral blood vessels constrict.</p>
<p>This response is great if you’re fighting for your life—if you’re cut, you’ll lose less blood and your blood will clot faster. But if you’re
sitting at breakfast reading the morning paper, vascular resistance will only raise your blood pressure and significantly increase your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Vascular resistance affects blood vessels throughout the body, not just in your fingertips. The coldness in your hands and feet indicates
that billions of cells are suffering from reduced metabolic efficiency. That means less oxygen is getting to those cells and less carbon dioxide and other wastes are being removed. It means that fine blood vessels in the brain are constricting and cerebral blood flow is reduced. And because caffeine increases brain activity at the same time, a situation known as relative brain hypoperfusion results.</p>
<p>In this condition, the brain is deprived of oxygen, and the consequences, when repeated day after day, can be quite serious.</p>
<p>With daily caffeine use, another stress hormone known as cortisol becomes elevated.</p>
<p>Cortisol is that it tends to remain in the bloodstream much longer than epinephrine or norepinephrine.</p>
<p>People who consume more than 300 milligrams of caffeine per day may have elevated serum cortisol for eighteen out of every twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Quality of their sleep is diminished, their immune system is adversely affected, age-related deterioration is accelerated, and there is a gradual but significant change in mind, mood, and behavior.</p>
<p>Not only is caffeine addictive, but it also encourages other addictions to substances like nicotine. The key factor in this interaction appears to be a brain chemical known as dopamine.</p>
<p>The center of the adrenal gland, called the medulla produces two major biochemicals: epinephrine and nor-epinephrine.</p>
<p>We need these hormones for more than the occasional emergency.</p>
<p>Epinephrine and norepinephrine are also required for any stressful activity, including sports and recreation.</p>
<p>Surrounding the medulla is the adrenal cortex, which produces a variety of other hormones that help regulate blood pressure, blood
sugar, mineral levels, immune activity, inflammation, and cell growth and repair.</p>
<p>In all, more than 150 hormones are produced by the adrenals or metabolized from adrenal hormones.</p>
<p>One group, known as glucocorticoids (including corti-sol), act as a brake on the immune system. This is an essential function that
prevents overenthusiastic immune cells from attacking the body’s own healthy tissues.</p>
<p>Excess glucocorticoid production (caused by stress and caffeine) can profoundly suppress immunity.</p>
<p>There is an intriguing but not fully understood connection between stress, caffeine, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus, and MS. Now we know that the onset of autoimmune disease is very frequently preceded by a period of severe stress or depression, but it’s not simply that stress weakens the adrenals and leads to poor immune control.</p>
<p>DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) can accurately be called the vitality hormone.</p>
<p>The adrenals produce it in abundance during youth, helping to create the energy, optimism, sex drive, and high level of immunity we enjoy in our twenties.</p>
<p>DHEA is the precursor to other essential sex and youth hormones such as testosterone and estrogen.</p>
<p>At about age twenty-five, DHEA levels start to drop, and this decline continues until at age seventy, most people are only producing about
15 percent of prime peak. The effects of low DHEA are unfortunate and far-reaching: decreased energy, decreased immune competence, and immune dysregulation contributing to autoimmune disease.</p>
<p>Low DHEA obviously contributes to decreased sex drive, as well as reduced ability to repair and rebuild tissues.</p>
<p>Much of the degeneration associated with aging can be avoided by maintaining high levels of DHEA. That, of course, is going to be
terribly difficult if you’re drinking a lot of coffee— since caffeine elevates cortisol, which leads to DHEA deficiency stress and caffeine create such a high need for cortisol that the exhausted adrenals simply cannot maintain production of DHEA at optimal levels.</p>
<p>Caffeine can lower the stress threshold (the point where stress becomes distress).</p>
<p>You cannot raise brain levels of GABA by eating it.</p>
<p>Caffeine, it turns out, disrupts the normal metabolism of GABA.</p>
<p>But when there’s caffeine (or its metabolites) in your bloodstream, you are unlikely to experience deep sleep at all.</p>
<p>Caffeine at any time of the day can cause sleep problems, especially if you are under stress.</p>
<p>Caffeine contributes to fatigue in at least three other ways. Adrenal exhaustion results in profound tiredness, as can blood sugar
abnormalities associated with caffeine use. And we’ve already seen in Chapter 2 that the muscle tension resulting from stress can
use up tremendous amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Caffeine plays a major role because it stimulates the fight-or-flight stress response described earlier. As part of this response, the liver
rapidly raises blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Body must then deal with the metabolic emergency of hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar). This is accomplished by the pancreas, which secrets insulin, driving the blood-sugar level down.</p>
<p>In some individuals, however, blood sugar may decrease to levels below normal, resulting in hypoglycemia and the all-too-familiar “letdown” feeling a few hours after the coffee lift.</p>
<p>Causes an increased loss of thiamin and other B vitamins in the urine.</p>
<p>Loss of calcium and other minerals.</p>
<p>As little as 150 milligrams of caffeine caused increased loss of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and chloride in the urine.</p>
<p>Zinc was added to the list of nutrients depleted by caffeine.</p>
<p>A single cup of coffee can reduce iron absorption from a meal by as much as 75 percent.</p>
<p>Low iron can seriously affect energy, immunity, and even brain function long before anemia develops.</p>
<p>Caffeine resulted in significantly lower levels of melatonin.</p>
<p>While the adrenals are busy fighting a phantom enemy, real enemies may go unchecked. The adrenals are responsible for helping mount an immune attack against a wide range of pathogens.</p>
<p>Studies show that adrenal hormone production may triple during acute infection.</p>
<p>If stress is prolonged, adaptive mechanisms may fail, leading to serious and chronic illness.</p>
<p>Another gradual effect of caffeinism is that your concentration becomes one-dimensional. You tend to lose the big picture because you
can’t step back from what you’re involved in.</p>
<h3 id="caffeine-and-your-mind">Caffeine and Your Mind</h3>
<p>Habitual and light caffeine consumers had basically the same increase in stress hormones, proving that people do not develop a tolerance to the anxiety-producing effects of caffeine. Rather, people simply become accustomed to the feelings of stress, irritability, and
aggressiveness produced by the drug.</p>
<p>Chronic caffeine ingestion may cause or exacerbate anxiety and may be associated with depression and increased use of anti-anxiety drugs.</p>
<p>Caffeine may aggravate the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.</p>
<p>Chronic users who are caffeine-sensitive may have symptoms of caffeinism at relatively low doses</p>
<p>As little as 100 milligrams of caffeine (a six-ounce serving) can cause a significant <em>decrease</em> in recall and reasoning.</p>
<p>Nature did not design the stress response to enable us to engage in abstract or global reasoning, such as may be required for complex
tasks or final exams. The stress response causes a shift of mental function to a very primitive survival-oriented part of the brain known as the limbic system.</p>
<p>Adenosine receptor antagonists (such as caffeine) have a depressive effect on other brain biochem-icals, such as acetylcholine.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter directly involved in memory and learning, this could account for some of the observed negative
effects.</p>
<p>Caffeine causes a remarkable decrease in cerebral blood flow.</p>
<p>Caffeine, even in small doses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor.</p>
<p>A dose of 250 milligrams (approximately fifteen ounces of coffee) produced approximately a 30 percent decrease in whole-brain cerebral
blood flow.</p>
<p>At the same time, caffeine increases blood pressure in the brain, leading to an increased risk for stroke.</p>
<p>Caffeine reduces the oxygen level of brain tissues.</p>
<p>Stress and caffeine can abolish nearly all of the neurological benefits you might obtain from DHEA.</p>
<p>If you want the improvements in brain function that optimal levels of DHEA can provide, you’ll have to cut back on caffeine. That’s because there is a tug-of-war going on in your body between DHEA and stress hormones. When stress hormones predominate, your immune system, emotional state, energy, vitality, and DHEA levels all suffer—and aging is accelerated as a result.</p>
<p><em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</em> (DSM) includes an entire section on caffeinism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was it removed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can take three weeks or longer for stress hormones to return to normal after discontinuing caffeine.</p>
<p>Alcohol abusers who drink to counteract the anxiety and/or depression produced by excess caffeine intake.</p>
<p>When pregnant women consume caffeine, their babies are often born with a caffeine dependency.</p>
<p>Well-defined vicious cycle of caffeine intake: anxiety &gt; depression &gt; impaired sleep &gt; increased caffeine use &gt; anxiety &gt; &hellip;</p>
<p>As sleep improves, you would expect an increase in energy, but the ripple effect of benefits also included decreased pain, better mood, decreased reliance on prescription and over-the-counter drugs, enhanced immune function, and improvements in memory and learning.</p>
<p>Patients reported “feeling themselves” again. In some cases, where caffeine consumption had been lifelong, they were literally
discovering who they were for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="specific-health-disorders-the-caffeine-connection">Specific Health Disorders: The Caffeine Connection</h3>
<p>A modest amount of caffeine taken before exercise produced dangerous elevations in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Caffeine is known to disturb calcium metabolism.</p>
<p>Intake of less than 300 milligrams per day has been associated with greater incidence of arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Caffeine can also cause tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) and can exacerbate the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a common heart
defect.</p>
<p>Caffeine can cause a sudden contraction of the aortic muscle, as well as dramatically increased stress hormone release in the heart itself.</p>
<p>Caffeine can increase the incidence of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) and ventricular beats, other types of heart rhythm disturbance.</p>
<p>Moderate caffeine ingestion appears to produce no abnormal HRV in young adults, it has been shown to aggravate abnormal HRV in
overweight, middle-aged subjects.</p>
<p>Spasm of one or more arteries leading to the heart. Known as coronary vasospasm, this event can shut
off blood supply as effectively as a clot or atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Caffeine contributes to coronary vasospasm in multiple ways. We know that caffeine, by stimulating the release of stress hormones, the stress threshold (review Chapter 3) so that situations that would otherwise have been handled become distressful. With this caffeine-induced stress “magnifier,” the risk of vasospasm is increased.</p>
<p>Caffeine also contributes to magnesium deficiency, a condition that makes arteries more prone to spasm.</p>
<p>A strong association between coffee consumption and elevated blood levels of a biochemical known as homocysteine.</p>
<p>Elevated homocysteine is a powerful contributor not only to heart disease, but also to stroke, miscarriage, birth defects, and possibly
Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>The elimination of homocysteine from the blood requires optimal amounts of folic acid, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6.</p>
<p>Caffeine depletes these vital nutrients. Secondly, caffeine appears to interfere with the normal breakdown of homocysteine. A diet high in meat and dairy products, on the other hand, tends to overload the system.</p>
<p>When measured at rest, caffeine raises blood pressure only a little. But when you add stress (either physical or mental), caffeine can
raise blood pressure significantly.</p>
<p>The GI tract has five major functions</p>
<p>1. Microbial Defense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caffeine Reduces Microbial Defense.</li>
<li>Caffeine interferes with the secretion and immune activity of secretory IgA.</li>
<li>As the stress hormone cortisol rises, slgA tends to fall.</li>
<li>Caffeine consumed with food can actually decrease the normal and necessary acid response to a meal.</li>
<li>This reduces both the digestive and the decontamination activity of your stomach.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Digestion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on when it is consumed in relation to food, coffee can either raise or lower production of HCL by the stomach. If acid levels rise too far or too fast, one group of problems is created, including increased risk for ulcer.</li>
<li>If HCL secretion is reduced, food will tend to ferment and putrefy, leading to the production of toxic by-products.</li>
<li>Coffee has been found to produce a chain reaction of maldigestion throughout the entire GI tract.</li>
<li>Coffee may also speed gastric emptying, meaning that the contents of the stomach are passed prematurely into the small intestine, cutting short the important gastric phase of the digestive process.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Essential Barrier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caffeine Impairs the Barrier Mechanism of the GI Tract</li>
<li>If material from the stomach is released too early, it tends to be excessively acidic, and this may injure sensitive intestinal tissue.</li>
<li>Thermal or acid-related injury to this tissue is known to compromise the barrier function of the gut, leading to the absorption of materials that you really don’t want in your bloodstream.</li>
</ul>
<p>4.Absorption:</p>
<ul>
<li>vitamins and minerals that are known to be affected.</li>
<li>Thaimin and other B Vitamins</li>
<li>Calcium</li>
<li>Magnesium</li>
<li>Potassium</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Zinc</li>
<li>In animal experiments, coffee and tea were both found to decrease the bioavailability of protein</li>
</ul>
<p>5.Elimination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Caffeine Disturbs Normal Elimination</li>
<li>Coffee is a frequent cause of both constipation and diarrhea</li>
<li>Can also cause constipation due to its diuretic action</li>
<li>Caffeine tends to pull water out of the digestive tract, leading to hard stools that are difficult to pass.</li>
<li>Many coffee drinkers become dependent on this laxative action. Without the caffeine stimulation, they experience what is known as “rebound constipation.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The undeniable coffee connection has to do with the effect that coffee (even decaf) has on the valve between the esophagus and the stomach.</p>
<p>Coffee reduces the pressure on this valve so that the highly acidic contents of the stomach are allowed to pass up into the esophagus.</p>
<p>Heartburn sufferers have been found to produce <em>less</em> stomach acid when given coffee.</p>
<p>Stop drinking coffee, tea, and soft drinks. Eat slowly and chew well.</p>
<p>Eat smaller, more frequent meals, start an exercise program and make it a regular habit, learn a stress management technique and take some time off, sign up for a yoga class and learn the breathing exercises.</p>
<p>Make sure to get at least eight hours of sleep a night, and slow down!</p>
<p>Life’s too short to suffer with internal bleeding from a perforated intestinal tract.</p>
<p>Individuals with chronic back pain were found to be consuming an average of nearly 400 milligrams of caffeine per day</p>
<p>The drug disrupts calcium ion flow through what are known as calcium-release channels. Smooth muscle lacks these caffeine-sensitive calcium-release channels, so there is no contraction. Skeletal muscle, however, is rich in calcium-release channels, and thus caffeine can cause contraction or spasm.</p>
<p>A procedure called the caffeine contracture test measures the degree to which a muscle contracts in response to caffeine.</p>
<p>A syndrome of muscle pain after exertion has also been identified in humans, and once again, the marker appears to be increased sensitivity to caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a common trigger for migraine and other types of headache.</p>
<p>Caffeine increases tension in the jaw, shoulders, back, and neck. It has a powerful vasoconstrictive effect in the brain.</p>
<p>A caffeine deprivation (withdrawal) headache results from the normal opening (dilation) of blood vessels that are constricted by caffeine.</p>
<p>One of the primary markers of aging, of course, is dehydration, and the loss of water from our tissues is accelerated by caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a known mutagen. That is, it can cause replication error, either by damaging the DNA blue print or disrupting communication of
that information to other “builder” molecules like RNA.</p>
<p>Caffeine has been shown to inhibit DNA repairs.</p>
<p>Caffeine magnifies the DNA-damaging effects of other mutagens.</p>
<p>Caffeine may very well potentiate free-radical damage in a number of ways:</p>
<p>1.Caffeine directly reduces tissue levels of melatonin, an antioxidant critical to the protection of DNA.
2. In animal experiments, caffeine magnifies the free-radical damage produced by radiation exposure.
3. Caffeine raises stress hormone levels, which are known to accelerate free-radical damage.</p>
<p>Caffeine = Stress, and that dearly leads to degeneration and aging, not vitality and youthfulness.</p>
<p><em>Caffeine raises blood sugar levels</em> and disrupts the blood sugar-regulating effect of insulin.</p>
<p>Has been shown to produce transient insulin resistance that is very similar to Type II diabetes.</p>
<p><em>Caffeine raises fatty acid levels</em> in the blood.</p>
<p><em>Caffeine raises homocysteine levels</em></p>
<p><em>Caffeine causes vascular resistance</em></p>
<p>Peripheral circulation is already impaired in diabetes, and the added effect of caffeine can prove disastrous.</p>
<p><em>Caffeine raises stress hormone levels</em>,</p>
<p>Chronic stress, including feelings of irritability and hostility, has been linked to the development of insulin resistance, leading to the
diabetic state.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemic state can be induced and/or exacerbated by caffeine.</p>
<p>Imagine if you had to live in a constant state of “emergency alert.” It would be exhausting. In the same way, the adrenal glands, designed
for episodes of stress (emergencies) in which tremendous energy is needed to fight or run away, find themselves in a situation where
heightened activity is required <em>all the time.</em> And it’s not just job stress.</p>
<p>It’s metabolic stress from poor food choices, pollution, and electromagnetic radiation. It’s the pace of twentieth-century living
and the breakdown of family (tribal) support groups and community.</p>
<p>And on top of that, most people add caffeine, a drug that elevates stress hormones and can keep them elevated eighteen hours a day. For the poor adrenals, there’s just no rest.</p>
<p>Adrenal weakness or adrenal insufficiency</p>
<p>After a certain point, your adrenals are so exhausted that the pendulum swings the other way. And that’s when you become most vulnerable to a whole new group of problems associated with adrenal exhaustion: namely, disorders related to inflammation and
autoimmunity, among them allergy, asthma (inflammation of the bronchial airways), and even rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>Mood disorder and the inflammation may both be related to adrenal insufficiency.</p>
<p>DHEA appears actually to help restore adrenal function.</p>
<h3 id="caffeine-and-womens-health">Caffeine and Women&rsquo;s Health</h3>
<p>Women detoxify coffee much more slowly than men. What’s more, the half-life of caffeine (the time it takes the body to eliminate one-half of a given dose) changes according to a woman’s menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>Iron deficiency, inadequate calcium intake, osteoporosis, and depression are devastating problems for women.</p>
<p>Caffeine dramatically reduces iron absorption.</p>
<p>Caffeine increases calcium loss and risk of osteoporosis.</p>
<p>Caffeine produces short-term mood elevation, but contributes to rebound depression.</p>
<p>Postmenopausal women?</p>
<p>A significant association between caffeine consumption and reduced bone mass.</p>
<p>Documented cases have appeared in the medical literature showing that anemia was <em>incurable</em> until the patient stopped consuming caffeine.</p>
<p>Woman will typically be iron deficient for <em>two to three years</em> before she becomes anemic.</p>
<p>Simple and inexpensive blood test that measures body stores of iron, called serum ferritin.</p>
<p>Serum iron is a meaningless test. It only tells you how much iron is traveling through your blood.</p>
<p>Serum ferritin is also the only iron indicator that is able to differentiate between true iron deficiency and anemia due to
infection.</p>
<p>Most symptoms are related to energy and mental alertness, so the connection with caffeine is more than casual.</p>
<p>A woman with low iron stores is likely to have low energy and a hard time concentrating. Chances are she will also be depressed.</p>
<p><strong>Ferritin Level</strong>: <strong>Iron Status</strong>
0–10 Severe iron deficiency
10–18 Marginal iron deficiency
18–40 Adequate
40–100 Optimal iron nutriture</p>
<p>Most bioavailable form of iron I have found is a chelated iron, known as iron glycinate.</p>
<p>If your ferritin is between 18 and 40, premenopausal women should still consider iron glycinate at 30 milligrams per day.</p>
<p>Vitamin C has been shown to enhance iron absorption. If your supplement does not already contain vitamin C, take a 200-milligram
tablet of vitamin C with your iron.</p>
<p>Avoid other iron robbers: sugar, high doses of calcium supplements (especially calcium carbonate), phytic acid (wheat bran), and oxalic
acid (spinach, beet tops).</p>
<p>Even marginal iron deficiency—what I call iron insufficiency—can contribute to mood, memory, and learning disorders long before anemia
ever develops.</p>
<p>The more caffeine you ingest, the worse your PMS will be.</p>
<p>Episodes of depression during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle have been linked with elevated cortisol and caffeine consumption</p>
<p>Caffeine is associated with decreases in levels of estradiol.</p>
<p>Caffeine ingestion also tends to lower blood levels of bioavailable testosterone in women, and raises levels of sex hormone binding
globulin.</p>
<p>Eliminating caffeine can help reduce both the number of hot flashes and their intensity.</p>
<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in their breast tissue. Since caffeine is known to increase cAMP.</p>
<p>Caffeine has been shown conclusively to cause fetal growth retardation.</p>
<p>Issue of unseen defects that would elude detection but still affect the baby’s health, such as decreased thymic weight (affecting
immunity) and degeneration of the lens of the eye.</p>
<h3 id="politics-and-pushers">Politics and Pushers</h3>
<p>The caffeine industry funds “public service” programs and prints brochures ostensibly to “educate” the public about caffeine.</p>
<p>People tend to crave fat when their stress hormone levels are elevated.</p>
<p>Commercially grown coffee is the most heavily sprayed food or beverage crop in the world (overall third, behind cotton and tobacco), and the chemicals that are liberally used include some of the most dangerous herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the chemicals sprayed on coffee plants are banned in the United States, and there is evidence that these chemicals are present at high levels on coffee beans.</p>
<p>Brazilian coffee beans (the most common type sold in the United States) were found to contain residues of DDT, BHC, lindane, aldrin, and chlordane, all known carcinogens.</p>
<p>The countries with the greatest loss of rain forest were those with the highest production of coffee.</p>
<p>But in the late 1980s some of the large coffee growers started shifting to a new hybrid coffee that grows in full sun. Without competition from other trees and plants, these plantations were planted more densely. Yields from sun coffee plantations were three to four times higher than traditional shade coffee farms, resulting in greatly increased profits.</p>
<p>Faced with competition from sun plantations, more and more growers started clear-cutting rain forest to increase their yields. This increased production coincided with two years of bumper crop production worldwide—and suddenly, in the early 1990s, there was a glut of coffee on the world market.</p>
<p>Remove the pulp of the coffee cherry from the bean and dry the green bean. The process takes large amounts of water over several washing steps.</p>
<p>But what happens to coffee pulp and the processing water? This water, now laden with pesticides, fungicides, and nitrogenous waste, goes directly into local streams, rivers, and lakes.</p>
<h3 id="options-and-alternatives">Options and Alternatives</h3>
<p>The acidity of coffee is higher in decaf because robusta beans are commonly used to produce decaf coffee.</p>
<h3 id="off-the-bean-and-on-to-vitality">Off the Bean and on to Vitality</h3>
<p>Other symptoms of caffeine withdrawal, like rebound constipation, are related to decreased muscular stress. With caffeine no longer contracting your intestinal muscles, you may experience sluggish elimination. It may take several months to restore the natural rhythm and function of your colon.</p>
<p>Fatigue, depression, and “brain fog” resulting from caffeine withdrawal.</p>
<p>Adjustment period is often perceived as a “letdown.</p>
<p>The human body is designed to last about 120 years, and that it is quite capable of sustaining a high level of energy until the very end.</p>
<p>When you exercise regularly, you are placing a demand on your body, and your body will respond by creating energy.</p>
<p>When the brain learns the muscles will be requiring more energy on a daily basis, it kicks into gear a whole cascade of metabolic reactions that make that energy available.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Scores of people have told me over the years that the most significant change they noticed when they got off caffeine was in their personality, how they related to their family, friends, and colleagues. This is the very essence of who we are as individuals and
how we act together as a society.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>Although chocolate does not contain a great deal of caffeine, it contains high amounts of a related compound known as theobromine. If you add the stimulant effects of both caffeine and theobromine, chocolate has the stimulating power of forty milligrams of caffeine per one-ounce piece.</p>
