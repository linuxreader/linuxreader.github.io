    <description>Boox Go 6 with ai, homescreen, naviball, and store app removed. [&#xA;User Review&#xA;](https://www.reddit.com/r/ereader/?f=flair_name%3A%22User%20Review%22)&#xA;I’ve been commenting a lot about this device lately, it’s slow out of the box and should work smoothly without having to run through settings; but you know how it goes. Make hardware for a device that would work well and then hold it down with bloatware and make the device miserable to use.&#xA;At first I just downloaded nova as a Home Screen replacement, this gave me access to the full android settings where I could turn off google sync, disable apps, pause and optimize them from running in the background and it was in a much better state from there.</description>
