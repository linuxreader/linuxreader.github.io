      <description>This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.</description>

      <description>Sex drive is a powerful force. And misusing it brings you down to the level of an animal. You must conserve and transmute this force to reveal your true gifts. Feeding lust makes you never satisfied, and spills over into all other areas in life. Giving a low rating because it’s overly religious for my tastes. And says that if you have sex, then you won’t have guy friends because you are afraid of being gay. Other than those two things, it’s a decent intro on the benefits you can experience from controlling your sexual side.</description>

      <description>Don’t argue with your kids. Manage behavior without getting angry. This was an exciting method at first but became un-managable. Focuses too much on last resort when all other methods fail. Instead of focusing on the all other methods. Very easy to use “breaks” and rewards to try and manipulate your child instead of teaching lessons and trying to get activities to be enjoyable in and of themselves. Read Playful Parenting instead.</description>

      <description>Quick read about creating the business (and life) that you want. These lessons spill over into other areas of life, maybe accidentally. Life isn’t all about maximizing profits and accelerated growth. Do what makes you happy. Treat your customers like rock stars and they will tell everyone.&#xA;Summary and Highlights A business plan should never take more than a few hours of work. Hopefully no more than a few minutes. The best plans start simple. A quick glance and common sense should tell you if the numbers will work. The rest are details.</description>

      <description>Just as good as Starrett’s other books. I would argue better if you really want to narrow down your focus to essential movement patterns. Could have been better and Kelly sometimes uses weird analogy’s that don’t make sense. Like the potato chip thing in his videos. Definitely one to keep coming back to to make sure you are doing these 10 things to keep you moving.</description>

      <description>Everyone should read this book. Caffeine does more than just block adenosine receptors so you don’t feel tired. Caffeine = Stress. Would have given it a 10/10 but there is some stuff about supplements that I do not agree with. I tried all of the supplements and they had their own side effects. I am also not able to look at the studies listed so a more modern approach with links would be nice. I have read this 4 times.</description>

      <description>We must separate the child from the behavior. Often, when a child’s behavior appears as “bad”, it’s really the child having a big emotion that they can’t regulate in a controlled way. Offers helpful tips on every day parenting struggles. Another parenting book that will give you a good frame of mind when thinking about your kids, but as I put this to practice, there are still challenging times where I have no idea what I am doing as a parent.</description>

      <description>I enjoyed reading this more than I thought I would. The emperor spent a great deal thinking about what it means to be human, philosophy, on life, on dying, and how best to navigate the world. Both the internal world of the mind and soul, and the external world of matter and other people.&#xA;This book makes me want to keep a better journaling habit. And study philosophy. And not worry about things that do not matter. Because we all become dust in the end anyway.</description>

      <description>I took a lot of highlights with this one. Motivational, inspiring, and practical. I will be coming back to these notes over and over as I embark on my business ventures. Don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. In fact, develop your asking powers like a muscle. Also, don’t try to figure out how to do something before you start. Just start and figure out how along the way.</description>

      <description>Easy concepts to grasp, challenging to apply to the real world. This is how we communicate with other people. I have been trying some of the methods and mindset while I was reading this book. Sometimes the strategies of using empathy and getting to know the needs behind words and behaviors have helped resolve tensions but other times it falls flat on it’s face due to me being very mechanistic about the whole thing. This is going to need a re-read at some point.</description>

      <description>This second half of the book was almost an identical copy of the second half of the book. But still filled with solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action.&#xA;I have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I’ve got down the process.</description>

      <description>Holy cow was this eye opening. Not only in regards to money, but the principles apply to many aspects of life. Strong story telling, clear and concise. Worth reading multiple times.&#xA;Summary and Highlights You don’t have to be a genius to do well with money. You just need to have the proper set of emotional and behavioral skills. These skills have nothing to do with having a finance degree.</description>

      <description>Summary and Highlights If you have a change of heart, your marriage will be on a new footing.&#xA;A change of heart is the force that erases the distress in relationships and gives you a fresh start.&#xA;A relationship dysfunction—a conflict, boredom or resentment—needs no healing time and is always reversible. A change of heart can occur in an instant.&#xA;Many marriage counselors say the past its unexpressed emotions and habit patterns—and poor communication are the “bad guys” that cause mental and relationship distress. These are the symptoms of relationship distress, not the cause. The cause, the real bad guy, is insecurity.</description>

      <description>This was a very insightful book. Knowing the balance between pain and pleasure is essential to living in modern day society. Where scarcity is no longer an issue. Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this.</description>

      <description>Incredible read. Could have been a little shorter but I picked up a bunch of new habits in the past couple months since reading this. How meditation can shift us to a less stressed mode of ourselves. When we are stressed we have less willpower. How exercise can increase willpower. How our brain plays tricks on us and how we can use that to our advantage. Like how we assume our future self will handle things better some day.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/booknotes/your-brain-on-porn/</guid>
      <description>Excellent primer on how addiction wires your brain. Explains the negatives of porn use without going into anything religious. Also gives tips on quitting porn use and includes many anecdotes of people describing how their lives changed when giving up porn use.&#xA;Summary and Highlights Sexual desire is one of our most powerful motivational forces, and has been essential to the flourishing of the human race. Yet pornography transforms that drive into a force that primarily motivates the completely solitary and unproductive activity of masturbation.</description>
