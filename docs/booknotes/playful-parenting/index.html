<p>Pretending to be mad helped me not to be really mad, and playing instead of shouting helped her get ready faster!</p>
<p>Play serves our incredible—almost bottomless—need for attachment and affection and closeness.</p>
<p>Play to recover from emotional distress.</p>
<p>Transform, through play, disconnection into connection.</p>
<p>They may be annoying, obnoxious, or downright infuriating as they try desperately to signal us that they need more connection.</p>
<p>These situations call for creating more playtime, not doling out punishment or leaving the lonely child all alone.</p>
<p>When children feel isolated, they can look withdrawn and depressed. Or they might look hyperactive instead, unable to pay attention, sit still, or calm down.</p>
<p>We may focus on the annoying behavior, not seeing the pain underneath, or we see the pain all too clearly and feel helpless to fix it.</p>
<p>If I take into account the time I used to spend nagging, fussing, and supervising, then I really come out ahead.</p>
<p>If children are too afraid of getting hurt, or expect to be rejected, or can't believe the world is theirs to explore, then they retreat.</p>
<p>Powerlessness is a well-defended fortress, perfect for hiding out, but it is also good for preemptive strikes: “I hate you.&quot;</p>
<p>Use play to help solve Problem behaviors.</p>
<p>Play is one of the best ways available to heal from those hurts and to process that new information.</p>
<p>Happy play can spontaneously heal minor upsets, but when children are stuck inside their emotional distress, they have trouble playing happily.</p>
<p>Even the healthiest, best-loved children will retreat into these two fortresses when they feel scared, overwhelmed, or abandoned.</p>
<p>Signs of isolation and powerlessness.</p>
<ul>
<li>play is wilder than usual, or more reckless.</li>
<li>Seem unable to play happily, and instead resort to hiding or attacking or annoying you.</li>
<li>Just going through the motions of life, without any real joy or spark.</li>
<li>Repeating the same words or games over and over without any fresh ideas and without having much fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play is one of the best ways to engage with children, pulling them out of emotional shutdown or misbehavior, to a place of connection and confidence.</p>
<p>When we are exhausted or when we are at the end of our rope, we tend to think that play will be just more of an energy drain. But when we engage playfully with our children, we find that suddenly we <em>do</em> have energy, both for fun and for finding creative solutions to thorny problems.</p>
<p>Our children want us and need us to loosen up.</p>
<p>And if we don't play, we miss out on more than fun. Play is where children show us the inner feelings and experiences that they can't or won't talk about. We need to hear what they have to say, and they need to share it.</p>
<p>Children don't say, “I had a hard day at school today; can I talk to you about it?” They say, “Will you play with me?” If we say yes, they play out what happened in the best way they know how.</p>
<p>Or they don't say anything, needing us to take the initiative.</p>
<p>If they don't think we will play, they may not even ask. They just go about their business, and we go about ours, and we all miss chance after chance to reconnect.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a child, keep all your wits about you, and sit on the floor.</p>
<p>When we get disconnected from children—and we do, again and again—play is our best bridge back to deep connection with them.</p>
<p>Play is children's main way of communicating. To stop a child from playing is like stopping an adult from talking and thinking.</p>
<p>To control every minute of their play is like controlling every word someone says.</p>
<p>But to leave children all alone in their play is like spending the day with other adults and never talking with them.</p>
<p>The adult role in play can be quite minimal—just making sure of basic safety and being there if needed. Some of our most important parenting happens when we are in a different room, while our children play happily, knowing we will come when they call.</p>
<p>Children have a special need of more active participation from grown-ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>When they are having a difficult time connecting with peers or adults.</li>
<li>When they seem unable to play freely and spontaneously.</li>
<li>When things are changing in their life (the start of kindergarten, the birth of a new sibling, a death or divorce in the family).</li>
<li>When they are in danger.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set aside special playtimes with each parent that involved a great deal of playful physical contact.</p>
<p>Wrestle, have pillow fights, and have piggyback rides around the house, as well as more hugs and more cuddle time.</p>
<p>Children are often punished or ignored when they are already feeling excluded and lonely.</p>
<p>Children need our approval and enthusiasm first, before they can get out of a rut.</p>
<p>When we constantly tell children what they should or shouldn't do, they have no room to think for themselves and are forced to choose between resentful obedience or defiant rebellion.</p>
<p>Playfulness helps them think for themselves, even about serious topics.</p>
<p>When young people have had effective adult participation in play, they can then get even more enjoyment from playing on their own.</p>
<p>WHY IT'S HARD FOR ADULTS TO PLAY</p>
<p>We have lost much of our ability to play—through lack of practice, and through adult preoccupations and worries.</p>
<p>This loss gets in our way of being with children we have to choose to play, even if we don't really feel like it.</p>
<p>Times when we have the most difficulties in playing with our children:</p>
<ul>
<li>When children are not connecting well with us or their peers, we usually feel disconnected as well (which may make us sad, mad, bored, or irritable, rather than playful)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When children's play is repetitive, aggressive, or inhibited, we usually want to punish them, ignore them, or get away from them—anything but join in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transitions are hard for adults, too. We have even less time and attention for children when we are preoccupied with big changes in our lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When our children are in danger, we may be too worried to be playful. (they might be in danger because we were not paying enough attention to them in the first place)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just when they need us most—when they act up and misbehave and call us names and so on we get angry and punish them, or feel hurt and block them out.</p>
<p>We momentarily forget how fragile our little ones are, just as they forget about cooperation or sharing or calming down or following the rules.</p>
<p>I CALL IT FATHERING</p>
<p>If men do not keep on speaking terms with children, they cease to be men, and become merely machines for eating and for earning money.</p>
<p>Boys who wrestle around with their dads get along better with other children. Dads are famous for jazzing things up, throwing babies in the air, engaging in special-occasion play.</p>
<p>They also need for men to expand their repertoires—to cuddle, comfort, and play dress up.</p>
<p>Effective play leaders need to possess technical expertise and creative curiosity, knowledge of children, a sense of humor, leadership capability, and community involvement skills…. They need to know the basic principle of affirming children's play.</p>
<p>And children benefit from a thoughtful, respectful adult who can be seen as an ally rather than as the enemy.</p>
<p>The first thing to notice is what children need.</p>
<p>Do they need help figuring something out? Are they too sleepy or hungry to think clearly? Do two
children need a break from each other for a while? Do they need to be outside where they can be louder and wilder? Maybe they need more attention.</p>
<p>Tell an interesting story from your day; they might respond with a story of their own.</p>
<p>Another mistake we make (I catch myself doing this frequently) is cutting them off when they are talking about “unimportant” things, or when they are chattering away about nothing, or when they are repeating themselves.</p>
<p>Then, later, we expect them to tell us what we want to hear.</p>
<p>That's not fair. We have to listen patiently to their way of telling things, even when it is excruciatingly dull to us, if we want them to get around to telling us the good stuff.</p>
<p>Understandably, they want to know that we are really listening and aren't going to interrupt them or scold them before they are going to share anything important with us.</p>
<p>The heartfelt connection we all yearn for is locked away within our everyday routine as parents, teachers, and friends.</p>
<p>When we join children in their world of play, we unlock the door to their inner lives and meet them heart to heart.</p>
<p>Disconnection can be a nightmare of painful isolation, withdrawal, and lashing out.</p>
<p>They retreat into towers of isolation when they feel lonely, afraid, or overwhelmed.</p>
<p>When everything is going smoothly, Playful Parenting is about having fun together. The rest of the time, Playful Parenting is all about drawing children out of their isolation.</p>
<p>The child's need for attachment with them is like a cup that is emptied by being hungry,
tired, lonely, or hurt. The cup is refilled by being loved, fed, comforted, and nurtured.</p>
<p>Insecurely attached children are more likely to be reckless than truly adventurous. Their cup is empty, or nearly empty.</p>
<p>Between return visits for refills, children with a secure attachment can soothe themselves, can handle their emotions, pay attention, connect well with peers, and feel good about themselves and the world.</p>
<p>When they are with strangers or day-care providers, securely attached children “save up” their bad feelings for when they reunite with their primary attachment figure.</p>
<p>Securely attached children can get their cup refilled from friendships, from having fun, or from
learning something new and interesting in school.</p>
<p>When children are bouncing off the walls think of them as racing around trying desperately to get a refill.</p>
<p>They lock the cap on their cups so they won't lose the little that is left, but then they can't get a refill very easily. Lacking confidence in the refilling process, they might refuse a hug, or refuse to go to bed, or refuse to sit and eat dinner.</p>
<p>Acting up and getting punished can be a way of getting a bit of a refill when it seems that a free fill-up is unavailable.</p>
<p>The usual response, to ignore these children, makes them only more desperate for a refill.</p>
<p>Children who seem to have leaky cups are annoying to adults.</p>
<p>The more you cuddle them, the more they cling to you; the more you give, the more they seem to need. They never get a full refill because their leaky cup can't contain everything they get and store it up for later.</p>
<p>Metaphor of the leaky cup also helps explain children who try to punch you when you go to give them a hug. Like drowning swimmers who fight off the lifeguard, they are so disoriented by being left empty that they react aggressively when you try to give them a refill.</p>
<p>Their cups empty faster when they are yelled at, hit, neglected, or
harshly punished.</p>
<p>Children count on us for refills, and they feel hurt and betrayed when
we knock their cups over instead</p>
<p>This betrayal is even worse when an adult actually <em>cracks</em> a child's cup, through abuse or neglect. A cup with deep cracks in it is hard to ever refill. This child may need a full repair, which takes a concerted effort by parents and/or good therapy.</p>
<p>Most important thing we have to offer to our children is our ability to make them feel loved, respected, wanted, and welcome.</p>
<p>Attachment isn't just about being connected, it's about getting a big kick out of being alive and out of interacting with other human beings.</p>
<p>A real refill can occur only between humans—not between a child and a television set or computer, no matter how “interactive” it may be.</p>
<p>The key to secure attachment is responsiveness—a sensitive response to the child's needs by the caregiver.</p>
<p>Make goofy faces, give hugs, or provide a deep sense of safety and security.</p>
<p>Play to reconnect after connection has been severed.</p>
<p>For very young children, mirroring is a perfect connection game: just do exactly what the baby or toddler does.</p>
<p>Older kids love this game, too—in the nature of Simon says or follow the leader—as long as you are careful that they don't feel teased.</p>
<p>Engage their children age three, or six, or even older, in soulful eye contact.</p>
<p>Persist through the initial rejections, and get to that deeper level of closeness, they find it to be one of the most rewarding exercises.</p>
<p>Climbed onto my lap and sat there. Neither of us said a word for more than half an hour.</p>
<p>We were truly close. When everyone else came down for breakfast, I said, “Great talking to you.” We both laughed, but I meant it.</p>
<p>With no pressure to communicate my way—using words—we were able to connect just fine.</p>
<p>Boys are especially prone to feeling isolated. And, of course, their aggressive play tends to isolate them more.</p>
<p>Hey, you found the love gun. when I get shot with that gun, I just have to <em>love</em> the person who shot me.</p>
<p>And I opened up my arms wide and took a step toward him with a big, goofy, lovestruck grin on my face.</p>
<p>Putting my hand to my heart and making up bad poetry about my lifelong devotion to her.</p>
<p>When children's play turns to kicking, punching, biting, or spitting. “You got me with a love kick, now I have to hug you.</p>
<p>Sometimes they'll say, “No, this is a hate gun.” I just say, “Oh, it must be broken because it's making me love you.”</p>
<p>This approach is only for aggressive <em>play</em>, not for situations when children want to directly express their feelings of anger or frustration.</p>
<p>In these cases, it is very important to hear them out, to allow the feelings to come out, rather than try to cheer them up or cajole them out of feeling bad.</p>
<p>Holding them close rather than by sending them away.</p>
<p>Whether playing or listening or holding, the key is to push for a close and meaningful connection.</p>
<p>Love gun has infinite variations: If they barricade themselves in a room, I slip love notes under the door and beg and plead to be allowed in. If they laugh and start sending messages back, I know I'm
on the right track. If they come at me with both arms swinging, I say, “Oh, you want to dance, I'd love to dance,” and I take both their hands and start dancing and singing.</p>
<p>All of those behaviors adults find so annoying or threatening are just attempts to make a human connection, but this game shows how true it is.</p>
<p>Chase, tag, follow the leader, and hide-and-seek are obvious examples. Play these games with your child—you'll not only have fun, you'll notice an improvement in your relationship with them.</p>
<h3 id="game-youll-never-get-away">Game: you&rsquo;ll never get away</h3>
<p>Say, “You'll never be able to get away from me, never in a million years!” The child comes over to check this out. I hold on to them, and after a little struggle I let them escape.</p>
<p>To make it more interesting, I pretend not to notice.</p>
<p>For a minute that they have escaped: “You see, you'll never get away…. Hey, how did you do that?</p>
<p>If they like it (and I have had success with this game with two-year-olds up to eleven-year-olds), I keep it up, saying, “Okay, you think you're so strong. This time I will use the famous Franklinheimer Maneuver; no one has ever gotten out of that,”</p>
<p>With some children, I gradually increase the resistance so they must increase the effort it takes them to get away.</p>
<p>They seem to thrive on the growing challenge.</p>
<p>If they don't like to be held, I pretend to hold them with my “psychic powers” and dare them to try to escape.</p>
<p>It works best when the adult provides the insistence on connecting, but the child actually sets the terms of how the two are going to connect.</p>
<p>Mother pointed out the need to connect but didn't impose any particular way. Instead she listed some vague possibilities, just to explain the concept, until her son jumped in with an idea.</p>
<p>Shhh, don't tell anyone my secret name—only my closest friends call me Stinker.”</p>
<p>Hey, you gave away my secret name, waaah!”</p>
<p>You're a stinker, and I hate you.</p>
<p>Oh, I had a great time playing with you, too, and I really like you, too. It's hard to say good-bye.</p>
<p>The key to unlocking the tower was just translating his insult into a request for some connection.</p>
<p>Wrote love notes and passed them under the door.</p>
<p>Read them out loud to him. I would say, “I love you; please come out and play,”</p>
<p>Reconnection takes persistence. One of my nieces and I have a little ritual when I see her. I say hi to her, and she ignores me. I keep saying hi, in a relaxed and cheerful tone, until she says hi back. We then laugh about how many times it took.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll try saying it in funny voices. I insist on contact, but it is a gentle insistence, not a harsh and punitive one.</p>
<p>This is a good game for us because I love her feistiness (her favorite expression last year was “I don't want to, I don't have to!”), but I also want to make sure we connect. Eventually, we always do.</p>
<p>When a child pretends to shoot you and says “You're dead,” try falling over dead, in a dramatic death scene, right on top of him.</p>
<p>Grab his leg and beg him to bring you to a doctor. If the child squirms away, go into even more dramatic death throes that bring you right back on top (as long as the young person giggles and enjoys the game, of course).</p>
<p>If your daughter calls you a stupid idiot, try being so stupid you can&rsquo;t tell her from a pillow, and try to take a nap on top of her.</p>
<p>When preteens act cool, pretending you don't exist, ask them if you can have the gum they are chewing so you can get close to them any way you possibly can. That's guaranteed to get a rise out of them. (You don't have to really chew it if they do hand it over, unless you are a stickler for full authenticity.</p>
<p>Or start a pillow fight with them or a wrestling match</p>
<p>Even the most disconnected behavior usually leaves some window open somewhere for connection.</p>
<p>They need to feel connected and confident before they can make any positive changes.</p>
<p>Get down on the floor and play what they want to play.</p>
<p>With older children, tuning in may mean sitting with them and listening to the music they like and watching the movies they rent.</p>
<p>Our first step was to have family cuddles.</p>
<p>Play creates an opportunity to express love and nurturing, gently repairing the wounds of earlier conflicts or upsets.</p>
<p>The mom could say things to the stuffed animals she might not be able to say directly to the child, such as, “We had a hard day; I hope you have sweet dreams.</p>
<p>The child might say to one of them, “You&rsquo;ve been very naughty; you have to sleep under the bed,”
allowing her mom the chance to say, “Oh, I think she feels real sorry and she could be in bed with the others; what do you think?</p>
<p>At the same time that I was trying to get her to exert her power and build her physical confidence, I was also encouraging her not getting so caught up in the competition that you forget whose side
you are on (theirs!).</p>
<p>Using an exaggerated, obnoxious voice, saying, “Why don't you just give up? You&rsquo;ll never make it to the couch.”</p>
<p>I went to the power room and got more power.</p>
<p>She had discovered a self-sustaining source of confidence and power.</p>
<p>The power room is an example of using play—in this case, wrestling—to promote confidence.</p>
<p>Playful Parenting helps children out of the traps of powerlessness and pseudo-power, tipping the balance in favor of true power, confidence, and competence.</p>
<p>Recognize and even enjoy the burst in independence, while providing the safety and structure of clear limits.</p>
<p>Powerlessness creeps in as a result of the setbacks children experience as they strive to feel confident and self-assured.</p>
<p>They can't do things as well as their older siblings or their peers, so they feel frustrated. They are criticized and punished and given grades, so they feel judged. They are flooded with messages about how they are supposed to behave, how they are supposed to look, what they are supposed to buy, so they feel inadequate.</p>
<p>The combined effect of these feelings leads children to retreat to the fortress of powerlessness, either down to the hidden dungeons (passivity), or up to the battlements (aggressive pseudo-power).</p>
<p>Games to play with these themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When I am called a poopyhead, I say, “Shhh, don&rsquo;t tell everybody my secret name</p>
<ul>
<li>Like clockwork, they shout out, to whoever may be listening, “Larry&rsquo;s secret name is Poopyhead!” I say, “Ha-ha—I was just kidding, my <em>real</em> secret name is Rice Krispies Cake”</li>
<li>The sillier the better, since the object is to break the tension about name-calling with some serious giggling).</li>
<li>“Larry&rsquo;s secret name is Rice Krispies Cake!” “No, no, I beg you, <em>pleeeease</em> don&rsquo;t tell anyone!” I&rsquo;ve played this game with some  children for hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poopyhead game:</p>
<ul>
<li>The child says some word that mom or dad doesn&rsquo;t want him or her to say—usually a body part or a bathroom word or an obscenity.</li>
<li>I say, “Well, you can say that all you want, but if you say Bobbledyboo you&rsquo;re gonna be in big trouble.” “Bob-bledyboo!” “Oh, ho, ho,” I say, “now you're in trouble.” I say this lightly, not in a mean, scary way, as I chase the child around the room.</li>
<li>They not only giggle like crazy and love the game, but they actually stop being so obsessed with saying those other words.</li>
<li>Lets children experiment with power—the power of words and the power to break rules. Instead of having them experiment on other children, which always causes hurt feelings, let them try out that name-calling and bathroom humor on you. This helps us step out of the power struggle and into play.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop and go game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dad started a few feet away, holding the nail scissors. He told her that when she said “stop,” he would stop immediately and he wouldn&rsquo;t go again until she said “go.” If she didn&rsquo;t say “go” after a short while, he could say it himself</li>
<li>But he would still have to stop when she said “stop.” She couldn&rsquo;t just say “stop-stop-stop-stop” real fast (this rule was added later, as she tried to test the limits of the game). When she said “stop,” he would stop in his tracks as if he were frozen.</li>
<li>Which always brought a giggle or two (already they were way ahead, since nail-cutting had never been associated with giggles before).</li>
<li>When she said “go” he would inch toward her.</li>
<li>Eventually the nails got cut.</li>
<li>Even more important, they had fun.</li>
<li>Stopping on a dime when she said “stop” built the trust that he wouldn&rsquo;t hurt her or force her.</li>
<li>Putting her in charge of his coming forward loosened up the whole situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They conveniently forget the amount of time they are already spending fighting or pleading or being annoyed.</p>
<p>I believe it is always worth the investment of time up front, even if your ultimate goal is to have to spend less time on these mundane activities</p>
<p>It can become such a fun game that it no longer counts as a chore.</p>
<p>Not protected from every little bump and bruise, but not toughened up either.</p>
<p>If they are treated with tenderness and respect while they overcome increasingly difficult challenges, they are truly prepared for the world.</p>
<p>You want him to enjoy himself; you want him to improve his skills; you want him to be a little competitive but not too competitive; you want him to be a good sport when he wins and a good sport when he loses; you want him to know that his peers aren&rsquo;t going to let him win like you do.</p>
<p>Start out letting them win, and then slowly play harder and harder. But it may go back and forth for a while, and even when children can beat you fair and square, they may still want to play by the “special rules” now and then.</p>
<p>Follow their lead.</p>
<p>You may also need to spend some time directly on the child's feelings about competition.</p>
<p>Set up a game where they will always win, and pretend to be a ridiculous figure of a sore loser.</p>
<p>Or brag about how great you are, then miss every shot—whatever helps them laugh and release that feeling of life or death over the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>Make up a game with a funny rule, like, “No hitting me with this pillow,” and then act goofy when they—surprise—hit you with it. “You cheated! Waaah&quot;</p>
<p>When I started trying a little harder on defense, he got nervous. He said, “Freeze,” and I froze in place, while he dribbled around me and scored. I said, in a pretend-outraged tone, “Hey, how can I defend the goal if I&rsquo;m frozen?” He said, “That&rsquo;s the rule, you freeze when I say so until I unfreeze you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nanny-nanny-boo-boo” when I had the ball and “Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha” when he scored a goal.</p>
<p>When children pass on this cruel teasing to me, my favorite response is to pretend to cry, in a very fake way, “Waaah!” Kevin laughed a lot when I did that.</p>
<h3 id="game-winning-and-losing">Game: Winning and losing</h3>
<p>It can be any game at all, as long as there is playful use of the ideas of winning and losing.</p>
<p>Flip a coin, heads or tails; if you lose, go into a Shakespearean death scene because you lost. “Alas, my life is over henceforth, for it hath come up tails….” If you win, announce that you are the greatest coin-flipper in the history of the universe; do a little victory dance, and then act real surprised when you lose the next toss.</p>
<p>Any game where the idea is to have fun with me losing or you losing or pretending it&rsquo;s real important who wins and who loses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lose, I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything. Your prize is a cuddle,” and then give them a big cuddle (or at least chase them around the house trying to give them one).</p>
<p>Extreme emphasis on winning, losing, success, and failure has pervaded childhood, even childhood play.</p>
<p>Adults are famous for taking all the fun and playfulness out of learning swimming or math. Even worse is our tendency to criticize children.</p>
<p>Criticism is a nasty habit, difficult to break. We feel as if we are being so helpful, but it is really no help. All it does is install a little voice in their head—or sometimes a very loud voice—that will criticize them ruthlessly and relentlessly for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>Children do this all the time—putting down their own work or their own abilities. And they often criticize each other mercilessly. (Of course they do—they learned it from us!) Sometimes, if we&rsquo;re lucky, they just need a little encouragement.</p>
<p>A smile or a nod. This lets them ignore the critical voice and go on with their creative flow or their learning process.</p>
<p>If the critical voice inside stops them from even trying, if it convinces them to give up on drawing or soccer or math or horseback riding or writing poetry, then we have to do more. We have to insist
that they keep at it.</p>
<p>That the critical voice is <em>not</em> the truth or the last word. Faced with a firm contradiction—“I know you can do it… you&rsquo;re a great artist”—the critical voice will often make a last gasp for control.</p>
<p>When we say this to children, they often cry or yell at us or insist they are stupid, they are bad at drawing, they hate math, they will never be good at sports.</p>
<p>All we have to do is listen, and maintain our confidence in them, while they release these feelings.</p>
<p>This may not sound too playful, but listening patiently to these outbursts is a crucial part of Playful
Parenting.</p>
<p>The process of growing up and learning things and mastering new skills brings lots of frustration, and this frustration is released by giggles (when you&rsquo;re lucky) or by tears (when it&rsquo;s too strong a feeling to come out in laughter).</p>
<p>Play serves an especially important role in children who have been traumatized.</p>
<p>When children seem to be struggling, adults can facilitate their recovery of confidence by playing with them.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you and your spouse have been arguing a lot, and you&rsquo;re afraid it is affecting your child. But your child doesn&rsquo;t want to talk about it, and you&rsquo;re not sure how to bring it up. Next time you &rsquo;re playing house, you can make the mom and dad dolls argue with each other, in a kind of silly way.</p>
<p>That gives the child the chance to pick up the theme, or drop it, whichever she wishes.</p>
<p>Have another doll tell the parents to make up, or she may say that she&rsquo;s running away from home, or give some other hint about her feelings.</p>
<p>For an older child, whom you think may be struggling at school about rejection by the “in group,” you might say, “Let&rsquo;s start a Beanie Baby club and the other dolls want to join.” Anything the child needs to master, playing a game about it can help.</p>
<p>Play “gives the child a safe space where she can experiment at will, suspending the rules and constraints of physical and social reality.</p>
<p>We know that lectures don't really work, but we keep giving them anyway, just in case, because we aren&rsquo;t sure what else to do.</p>
<p>A shared laugh is a big improvement over a moralistic lecture that falls on deaf ears.</p>
<p>When the adult exaggerates and really hams it up, that almost always makes children laugh.</p>
<p>Being goofy and silly usually gets giggles, also talk in a funny voice; don't talk at all if you can sing; don&rsquo;t stand up when you can fall over.</p>
<p>Pick up a stuffed animal or an action figure and make <em>it</em> say silly things in a humorous voice.</p>
<p>The older children get, the bigger the challenge they pose in the giggling department. You can&rsquo;t just fall over or make a goofy face for a guaranteed response.</p>
<p>Experiment with being outrageous or with telling jokes.</p>
<p>Pretending to cry, in a very fake way, especially if they hit me or insult me.</p>
<p>Unexpected response is a basic technique of comedy.</p>
<h3 id="game-sock">Game: sock</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each person tries to take off everyone else&rsquo;s socks while keeping his or her own on.</li>
</ul>
<p>All comics have tough audiences and days when they totally bomb.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble, try being more enthusiastic, more energetic, more wild than usual.</p>
<p>Young children may not get subtle jokes or high-brow humor. They are more likely to crack up by just the mention of the words <em>fart</em> or <em>poop</em> or <em>butt</em>.</p>
<p>Ask children to try to get <em>you</em> to laugh—you'll get a good picture of what <em>they</em> think is funny.</p>
<h3 id="game-the-serious-and-solemn-occasion">Game: The serious and solemn occasion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each person takes turns saying, “This is a very serious and solemn occasion,” with a perfectly straight face, trying not to laugh.</li>
</ul>
<p>We often forget the importance of laughter. We are especially forgetful, or especially serious, when we are dealing with children who are being obnoxious or aggressive or uncooperative, and when we have run out of patience and good humor.</p>
<p>Stress doesn't help much either. But these are the very conditions when Playful Parenting is most useful.</p>
<p>Laughing can be a sign of connection between people, a sign of successfully completing a challenging task, or a sign that a child no longer feels miserable or hurt.</p>
<p>Release fears and embarrassment and anxiety.</p>
<p>Use this technique of following the giggles to lighten up a conflict or a tense moment.</p>
<p>Tickling may bring laughs, but if it involves holding children down and tickling them against their will, don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<h3 id="game-the-tragic-shakespearean-death-scene">Game: The tragic Shakespearean death scene</h3>
<ul>
<li>A child pretends to shoot you, or hits you, or sticks out his or her tongue, or says “I hate you, you&rsquo;re stinky,” and you grab your chest and fall over right on top of the child, in a highly exaggerated and drawn-out death scene.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="game-love-potion">Game: love-potion</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is given a love potion in her eyes, which makes her fall madly in love with the first creature she sees, no matter how monstrous. That&rsquo;s exactly what children need: they feel monstrous sometimes, and they need to feel loved regardless of what they say or do.</li>
<li>When we engage with them on their terms they can take off the monster mask and return to their true selves.</li>
</ul>
<p>One way to induce heavy giggling is by singing corny love songs, reciting corny love ballads, and making up corny compliments.</p>
<p>Being on your hands and knees looking desperate helps with this one.</p>
<p>Love-potion game when children are trying to be gross—like when they&rsquo;re showing their half-chewed food or saying bad words. “Oh dear darling, that is the most beautiful sight I have ever witnessed. May I please get my sketch pad and draw a picture of it to have forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes all you have to do to get giggles is say “thank you” when you get insulted.</p>
<h3 id="game-human-tug-of-war">Game: human tug-of-war</h3>
<ul>
<li>If there are two adults available, pretending to fight over the child is always fun. “I&rsquo;ve got the head.” “Ha-ha, I&rsquo;ve got the feet, that&rsquo;s the best part.” “No, he&rsquo;s all mine, I love him so much.” This human tug-of-war is another example of a game that combines physical closeness and laughter.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exaggerations-of-affection">Exaggerations of affection.</h3>
<p>In spite of how well we may love them, they often feel unloved or unlovable.</p>
<p>Funny exaggerations of love and affection are a good way for many parents and children to express
their deep feelings for each other. It fills the empty cup, because the goofiness of it catches them off guard.</p>
<p>Imitation, if it is done thoughtfully, can bring a terrific sense of closeness. If done in a mean-spirited way, it builds walls between people.</p>
<p>You can tell which way it is leaning by whether the child giggles or not. Don&rsquo;t imitate children to annoy them or teach them a lesson. Instead, do it to join them, to follow their lead and express your deep desire to be close to them.</p>
<h3 id="laugh-together">Laugh together</h3>
<p>If we invite children to laugh at <em>us</em> during playtimes, they are less likely to laugh at other people in a rude way. So fall down a lot and pretend to cry loudly, “Waaah&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To help children with fears, for example, it often helps to play as if <em>you</em> are the one who is scared, and really exaggerate it.</p>
<p>Make sure they don't feel mocked or humiliated.</p>
<p>Pretend that I am scared of everything.</p>
<p>This type of play lets children get some distance from their fear, and the distance allows them to release the fear through giggles.</p>
<p>A less dramatic way to act incompetent is to play chase and let the child have one narrow escape after another. This game is even funnier if you pretend to be shocked and confused. “How did you do that? I had you! This time I&rsquo;ll <em>really</em> get you.” Then you miss again, of course, unless they laugh harder when you catch them and then somehow accidentally let them slip away.</p>
<p>Why is this so funny? The outrageous claims make the adult into a fool, which is funny enough, but especially since it helps them feel more powerful.</p>
<p>Children often try to make each other feel helpless, powerless, stupid, or incompetent so they don&rsquo;t have to feel that themselves.</p>
<p>That usually ends in conflicts and upsets. No one comes out ahead when one child tries to feel powerful at another child&rsquo;s expense. This is another reason adults need to participate in this kind of play—so that children won&rsquo;t do it to one another.</p>
<p>By making their escape harder and harder, but still letting them get away in the end, I am playing at the edge of the child&rsquo;s development.</p>
<p>If the real bathroom words or swear words bother you, make up your own words, make them “forbidden,” and then play at being shocked and horrified when you hear them.</p>
<p>One thing I do when I start to get a little bit frustrated with a young person, as an alternative to saying “I&rsquo;m going to send you to your room” or something like that, is to make a mock threat that lightens up the situation and turns it into play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do that one more time, I&rsquo;m going to pour water on my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pick up the glass of water, put it above my head, and they laugh. I don&rsquo;t actually pour it! They say, “Yeah, do it, do it!” But by then the whole tone has changed. Now we&rsquo;re both laughing instead of being frustrated and locked in combat.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s important to remember that this is a <em>mock</em> threat. Real threats and angry tirades lock in frustration by scaring children, practically ensuring that they will shut you out.</p>
<p>Funny mock threats, especially if they are aimed at yourself, release frustration. Once that frustration is released, cooperation is much more likely.</p>
<p>Real threats communicate: I'm mad at you, it's your fault, and you had better shape up.</p>
<p>The predictable result is defensiveness and conflict.</p>
<p>Mock threats mixed with humor can communicate: I&rsquo;m not happy with how things are going between us and I want us to fix it.</p>
<p>The result this time is a relaxing of the tension and a willingness to meet each other halfway.</p>
<p>if you are too mad to play this little game, you are probably too mad to be making real threats, also.</p>
<p>To turn tense situations into play, try being light and a little outrageous. I find that it helps to <em>pretend</em> to scream when I want to <em>really</em> scream.</p>
<p>Giggles can also be a part of making up if you have not been able to avoid a conflict.</p>
<p>We refuse to laugh, as if our lightening up would be a reward to the child for bad behavior. But laughter is healing.</p>
<p>For most difficulties between parents and children, the real problem is lack of connection. So the solution is more connection.</p>
<h3 id="game-playing-dumb">Game: Playing dumb</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lightens up tense moments.</li>
<li>Boy, that was awfully mean. What&rsquo;s going to happen next?”</li>
<li>If I play the heavy and give a lecture, they are going to forget what I have said in microseconds. They are taken by surprise with the village idiot approach, so they might stop and think about it.</li>
<li>Children often feel stupid—either secretly or not so secretly—and they long to see someone else look stupid for a change.</li>
<li>I do this by singing funny songs, falling a lot, dancing around, and otherwise looking quite foolish.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="game-captain-lex-von-vader-hook">Game: Captain Lex von Vader Hook</h3>
<ul>
<li>When children play the good guy, they don&rsquo;t want the bad guy to be <em>too</em> powerful. So I started singing a song: “I&rsquo;m Captain Lex von Vader Hook, I&rsquo;m the dumbest bad guy in town….”</li>
<li>I made it clear that no matter what powers I had, or no matter what character he was, I would <em>try</em> to get him, but he would <em>always</em> win.</li>
</ul>
<p>I realize I am asking a lot of parents when I suggest that we lose our dignity. A lot of adults have a hard time just loosening up. We&rsquo;re expected to be serious at work and just about everywhere else, but our children are begging for us to snap out of it and have some fun.</p>
<h3 id="game-ha-ha">Game: ha-ha</h3>
<ul>
<li>Standing very close, face-to-face, heels off the ground, bouncing lightly on the balls of your feet. Each person takes a turn saying “Ha!” in a friendly voice, back and forth, until both are howling with real laughter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try to have fun.</p>
<p>Setting aside time for high energy fun, complete with giggles, can be a new way to meet
everyone's needs. The hardworking mom or dad gets to unwind, the child gets some exuberant playtime, and everyone gets to reconnect.</p>
<p>Your children will be forgiving and patient, but they do want you to loosen up.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s over saying she hates us, but we&rsquo;re not.” Saying this out loud eased our tensions, and we laughed about it.</p>
<p>Sudden shifts—from giggles to tears or tantrums—happen because the child has a pile of backed-up feelings. She keeps the door to these feelings tightly shut. The fun play opens the emotional door to let out the giggles, and a flood of other feelings come pouring out after.</p>
<p>Once the tears start, they may last a long time. Very few parents realize how healthy it is for children to get this chance to shed some of that backed-up supply of uncried tears.</p>
<p>We make the mistake of fussing or yelling at the child, because the tears or outbursts seem
to be over nothing.</p>
<p>But old feelings latch on to the littlest excuse to come out from hiding, especially after a long fun playtime. If we can just sit with them while they are releasing these feelings, they will eventually
emerge happier children.</p>
<p>All the child needs is to be cuddled (if she is crying) or listened to quietly (if she is tantruming), or held gently but firmly (if she is kicking and fighting in a way that might hurt somebody).</p>
<p>If you are prepared for these feelings you can just relax and let the child express them and be done.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t prepared, it is easy to get mad: “How dare you talk to me like that? I&rsquo;ve been playing with you for an hour. Quit crying, don&rsquo;t be a baby.</p>
<p>But these feelings aren't about <em>nothing</em>, they come from deep inside, and one of the great side benefits of giggly playtime is that it can let children feel safe enough to share them with us.</p>
<p>She is using that bump as an opportunity to release old unfelt feelings, now that she feels safe and close from all that giggling.</p>
<p>Often, all that is necessary is a brief pause to pay attention to that burst of feelings, then back to fun play—which becomes even more fun now that the child is no longer carrying that load of painful emotion.</p>
<p>Alexandra! I&rsquo;m going to look at you!” I proceeded to put my eyes close to her elbow and her head (“So I can look at you really closely”), and to make my eyes bug out from the exertion of looking at
her so hard. Both of us giggled the whole time.</p>
<p>A good school is one where you hear giggling and laughter in the halls and in the classrooms.</p>
<p>Children learn best when they are happy.</p>
<h2 id="roughhousing">Roughhousing</h2>
<p>Children who are less physically active need roughhousing with adults so they can explore their physical power and develop their confidence and assertiveness.</p>
<p>Story, in which a holy man, Milarepa, is not upset or scared by the presence of demons in his cave; he just casually offers them tea until they disappear. When children show us their wild and scary sides, we need to be as persistent as Jacob and as calm as Milarepa.</p>
<p>If we can stay with them, physically and emotionally, we will find the cooperative, loving, joyful human being who may have been buried under a pile of angry or scary or sad or lonely feelings.</p>
<p>Wrestling with them can help them find their true selves again.</p>
<p>They may need you to lose your dignity and be totally incompetent so they can feel powerful.</p>
<p>Or you match your strength to theirs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Provide basic safety.</li>
<li>Find every opportunity for connection.</li>
<li>Look for every opportunity to increase their confidence and sense of power.</li>
<li>Use every opportunity to play through old hurts.</li>
<li>Provide just the right level of resistance to the child&rsquo;s need.</li>
<li>Pay close attention.</li>
<li>(Usually) let the child win.</li>
<li>Stop when someone is hurt.</li>
<li>No tickling allowed.</li>
<li>Keep your own feelings from getting in the way.</li>
<li>No hitting, no biting, no punching, no kicking, no head locks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The child avoids eye contact, you might say, “Before we battle to the death, let us do the ancient warrior custom of looking each other deep in the eyes.”</p>
<p>Child&rsquo;s crossing the line may not have to mean an end to the play. Rather, it is another opportunity for connection. Set the limit in a relaxed way, then return to the game or the wrestling.</p>
<p>If verbal limits don&rsquo;t work, and the aggressive or dangerous or destructive behaviors continue, see if you can wrestle in such a way that no one gets hurt.</p>
<p>Look for every opportunity to increase their confidence and sense of power.</p>
<p>Use every opportunity to play through old hurts.</p>
<p>If a child faced a difficult challenge earlier in the day and was not pleased with the outcome, she can replay it with you.</p>
<p>Provide just the right level of resistance to the children's needs.</p>
<p>Signs that something is amiss are lack of eye contact, giving up, blind rage, or the child&rsquo;s actually trying to hurt you.</p>
<p>When the feelings are done most children exhibit a remarkable change. They look deeply into your
eyes, they smile and laugh, they want to try something that before they felt was too difficult.</p>
<p>Very minor scrape or bump can make some children (and adults) want to give up. They need respectful and gentle encouragement to give it another go.</p>
<p>Even if you think the child is pretending to be hurt, it is still important to stop—in this case, to regroup and go slower or provide less resistance.</p>
<p>Fake cries and whimpers of pain are signs that the child feels overwhelmed and that things need to be toned down a notch or two.</p>
<p>Tickling can be confusing; the laughing seems to mean children are enjoying it, even if they may not be. So best to avoid it when you are wrestling.</p>
<p>Move toward them as if you&rsquo;re about to tickle, and then back off—you&rsquo;ll get the same laughter without the out-of-control feeling.</p>
<p>Aim more for giggles from the child than for superhuman physical prowess.</p>
<h1 id="left-off-here">Left off here</h1>
<p>If you have feelings that you can&rsquo;t set aside, be honest about them (but be humorously honest, not <em>brutally</em> honest). In fact, the best thing to do is exaggerate them. “I am so tired, I can&rsquo;t stay awake
another second. You&rsquo;ll have to get me onto the couch. If I wrestle one more second, I will surely</p>
<p>die.” “Waaah, that hurt, boo-hoo! You stepped on my toe. I will never
be your friend again….” “If I don't win, I am going to sulk all day.”</p>
<p>you could kneel on the floor and say, “Try to knock me over.”</p>
<p>pretended to be an ox</p>
<p>I stood at one end of the room bragging about how strong and powerful
and smart I was, insisting that she could never, ever get past me.
Then she would trick me and somehow get across the room. I acted
shocked and went over to the other side of the room to do it again. At</p>
<p>Part of the fun of this game was my taking a few seconds to keep
bragging after she had already gotten past me. Children love it when
you continue to brag after they've beaten you, especially if you
exaggerate a double take of shock and dismay that <em>somehow</em> they have
once again eluded your</p>
<p>grasp</p>
<p>when young humans</p>
<p>especially boys, play fight. They aren't just practicing aggression,
they are practicing restraint and control as well</p>
<p>death scenes when the child says “Bang bang, you're dead,” or to
introduce themes of nurturing (the army medic) and caring (the devoted
soldier buddy) into the play.</p>
<p>some parents allow magical weapons such as wands and dragons' teeth,
but not imaginary guns and bullets. Trying</p>
<p>to eradicate all aggressive play always backfires. Unable to play out
the aggressive feelings that</p>
<p>they have inside, they may think that something is wrong with them,
because they aren't ever supposed to feel angry or violent</p>
<p>Billy Goats Gruff—she takes great delight in butting and kicking the
troll off the bridge</p>
<p>Games like Simon says, red light/green light, and so on aren't about
aggression, but they <em>are</em> about control over impulses</p>
<p>Another idea is to have her bite something like a rag or a doll. Then
the parent can say, “Okay, bite harder, bite softer, bite quickly,
bite longer,” and so on. These rapid shifts that teach self-control
are also fun.</p>
<p>One problem with TV is that after hours of sitting in school, children
don't need more hours of sitting in front of a screen</p>
<p>In rare instances, TV can be a simple resting spot, and then the child
can return to more interesting and creative play</p>
<p>saps the energy and enthusiasm and creativity out of children and
leaves them semicomatose on the couch</p>
<p>bones heal faster than timidity and fearful-ness</p>
<p>how much better psychologically it was to give children piles of sand,
sticks, hammers, nails, and wood, instead of games and store-bought
toys (he would surely have railed against TV), despite the risk of
injury</p>
<p>examples of how active physical play can help children:</p>
<p><em>Self-soothing.</em> Self-soothing is the ability to comfort and calm
yourself even if you are alone, and it is a major accomplishment of
in-fancy—though many of us still have</p>
<p>difficulty with it</p>
<p>When children have a general difficulty in calming down or recovering
from an upset, they need lots of cuddling time. But look at what
happens: If children can't settle down, they can't get the cuddling
they need. Boys are especially unlikely to get all the comfort</p>
<p>and cuddling they need because they don't sit still for it. Wrestling
often helps them, since active children may do better with active
cuddling than the sit-quietly-on-the-lap type of cuddling</p>
<p>When children have a hard time calming down, parents are often
hesitant about</p>
<p>roughhousing. They are afraid that it will escalate, and that children
won't be able to settle down. But these are the children who need it
most. You can't learn to settle down if you never get revved up</p>
<p>Children with lots of energy who never get to roughhouse end up going
wild when they do get the chance</p>
<p>because they don't have any practice with calming down</p>
<p>If you start to wrestle regularly, both parent and child will learn to
do a better job of winding down</p>
<p>three deep breaths. I find it helps to do it with them. It helps them
breathe more deeply, and it helps adults relax, too</p>
<p>Children with difficulties in self-soothing also benefit from pretend
play with dolls, where they practice soothing the doll when it gets
upset, by cuddling it or laying it down</p>
<p>for a nap</p>
<p>The parent can help by pretending to be the cranky baby, or by
modeling nurturing, soothing behavior for children</p>
<p>setting aside several periods per day for a certain kind of play that
he calls self-regulation. The basic idea is to have the child jump,
run, swing, dance, do jumping jacks, or engage in any repeated
rhythmic movement. Then you call out frequent, rapid changes: “Go
faster, slower, slower, faster, superfast</p>
<p>Go right, go left, go right, go left…. Hop on your left foot, now hop
on your right foot, now hop on both feet</p>
<p>This game, which most children find fun and which works very well in
groups, is one of the best ways to make up for deficits in emotional
regulation</p>
<p>innumerable variations. Hand a child a pile of blocks and say, very
fast, “Sort by shape. Now sort by color. Now use your left hand.” If
they like to sing, say, “Sing louder, now softer.” If they scream, ask
them to scream their loudest, then a little softer, then a little
softer, then</p>
<p>whisper, and so on</p>
<p>Self-soothing and paying attention are actually quite closely related.
For example, it may look like Jed's problem is that he can't sit
still in his fourth-grade class. He may join the ranks of boys
diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. But perhaps the real</p>
<p>problem is that he can't soothe himself when he feels anxious or
frustrated</p>
<p><em>Motor planning and sequencing.</em> Some children have problems with what
is called motor planning and sequencing, which may be seen in
difficulty getting organized for school in the morning, or keeping
track of assignments, or seeing a project through to</p>
<p>the end. To help this problem through the use of physical play, create
an obstacle course, starting simple and making it harder as children
master it</p>
<p>For older children, make a treasure hunt, with clues that lead to more
clues. Once again, some activities that are more commonly played by
girls, like</p>
<p>complicated hand-clapping songs or jump-rope games, are helpful in
developing these skills.</p>
<p><em>Impulse control.</em> Children learn to control their impulses through
play</p>
<p>play out the situations where your child is impulsive. Just say
“Let's play school.” “Let's play getting dressed and ready.” “Let's
play that you want this toy real bad, and</p>
<p>won't share it with you.” “Let's play crossing the street—oh no, the
little bunny almost got hit by a car.”</p>
<p>Let's pretend that you're the dad and I'm the daughter, and you're
mad at me.”</p>
<p>lots of playtime that reverses the roles, suspends reality, and lets
them be in charge</p>
<p>They need to take on the more powerful role—the hero, the princess,
the perfect student</p>
<p>using play to come up with a new script and create a new, improved
reality</p>
<p>he reversed the roles so that I was the one who couldn't be trusted,
and he could be the one who was in charge of enforcing the rules</p>
<p>Role reversal is especially helpful for restoring children's sense of
confidence—escaping from the tower of powerlessness—and for overcoming</p>
<p>fears and inhibitions</p>
<p>At times, children play out these roles on their own, and all they
need from us is to be their stage manager or producer—providing the
play space, the toys, the refreshments. Other times, they need us to
be a responsive audience</p>
<p>A popular philosophy of child rearing suggests that the more we leave
children alone the better; benign neglect will allow them to blossom
and develop on their own. That might be fine if it weren't for the
intrusive influence of our culture and the media</p>
<p>“I'll be the kid who gets sent to the principal, and you can be the
principal,” I suggested, trying to set up the role reversal.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Mr. Sternly, the teacher sent me here, I'm not sure why;
maybe because I turned everything in the classroom over, including the
teacher and all the desks and the fish tank.</p>
<p>And the kids?”</p>
<p>Yes, and the kids, I turned everything over because I didn't get to
use all the blue markers like I wanted to. What's my punishment?”</p>
<p>I made a big show of falling myself, all four limbs and ski poles and
skis up in the air, aiming in different directions, shouting about
snow getting in my underwear</p>
<p>reversed the roles and became the less competent skier</p>
<p>That left her in the position of being relatively good at it, which
gave her a burst of confidence that let her enjoy it</p>
<p>Unfortunately for my wounded dignity, lectures and coaching didn't
help at all. It took a more playful response</p>
<p>to cut through her feelings of incompetence</p>
<p>What I usually do with older siblings, or any older or stronger
children who are picking on smaller ones, is to say to them, in a
mock-threatening voice, “Hey, pick on someone your own size.”</p>
<p>put up my fists in a parody of a fighter's stance, waiting for them
to come after me instead of their victim</p>
<p>Of course, I never beat them up! More often I run and hide under a
pillow, or let them flip me over, or do something else to get their
giggles going</p>
<p>Other times, I wrestle hard with them, giving them more of a run for
their money</p>
<p>than could the smaller child, who could only whine or tattle or scream
to get even</p>
<p>them (even if they've just finished clobbering a littler child). Give
them, in a gentle, playful way, the idea that they are not the boss of
the world. And at the same time, give them the idea that they can be
powerful without hurting anyone smaller</p>
<p>STORYTELLING TO HEAL FEARS</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>cared children need a way to heal from their fears</p>
<p>One way that helps is to tell the story of</p>
<p>what happened to them, either in words or by acting out the story in
play</p>
<p>children sometimes forget the details of scary events or refuse to
talk about them, because it is too painful</p>
<p>They may need</p>
<p>some gentle reminders of the incident from an adult, in order to
finish dealing with it and put it away</p>
<p>Adults, like children, often wish they could just forget about
terrible things that happen. But shoving it under the rug is not the
same as really dealing with it and putting it behind us</p>
<p>The point of</p>
<p>having the child tell the story is to allow her to discharge the
feelings connected to the memories and experiences. Without this
venting, the feelings leave a residue in the child's mind that will
haunt her later</p>
<p>Parents need to talk to each</p>
<p>other about the joys and difficulties of parenting, and especially to
share the incidents and feelings that seem too painful or embarrassing
or scary to tell.</p>
<p>Telling stories is also a way to tap playfully into the themes that
are important in children's lives. These stories work best when they
are thinly</p>
<p>disguised versions of the truth</p>
<p>but different enough to make it safe</p>
<p>make up stories that touch on the right themes and feelings without
hitting too close to home</p>
<p>some stories are just stories and don't have to be related to the
child's life.</p>
<p>Good stories are just the right blend of fact and fiction. They</p>
<p>As children grow older, we can shift from telling them stories to
listening to their stories</p>
<p>With children who are around ten or twelve, I love to</p>
<p>ask them to tell me their life story</p>
<p>Resist the temptation to butt in with your own perspective on the
story, or with extra details that you remember, unless they ask you</p>
<p>For younger children you can start the story for them, and ask them to
add whatever they remember, or imagine</p>
<p>Telling stories <em>together</em> is a great way to make sure the story is
neither too far a field nor too painful</p>
<p>Joint storytelling simply means that every once in a while you ask the
child for ideas on how</p>
<p>the story should go.</p>
<p>Sam Roth told me about a boy whose favorite game was joint
storytelling, where the child would create terrifying dangers for the
hero, while Sam would have to figure out ways to save him</p>
<p>The boy was</p>
<p>symbolically finding the right distance for talking about fears and
worries he could not talk about directly; Sam was symbolically talking
about safety and security.</p>
<p>It is important to let them be in charge of this emotional distance,
because they are deciding how much they can handle</p>
<p>Children who</p>
<p>have specific fears, for example, are likely to need our help. Most
children will not make up pretend games on their own to deal with
these fears; instead, they will just avoid the thing they fear</p>
<p>If they are afraid of bees, or the water, they may stop wanting to go
outside, or refuse to go swimming</p>
<p>If an adult initiates a fun game about it, children can gain
confidence that their fears can be overcome.</p>
<p>if a child is afraid of bees, you might say, “You be a bee and I'll
try to run away from you.” Let yourself get “stung,” and then scream</p>
<p>Or you say, “I'm a bee and I'm going to sting you,” but you</p>
<p>play the part of a klutzy, incompetent bee. Somehow you end up
stinging yourself every time, instead of the child</p>
<p>Or you keep bumping into walls and falling over on the floor. Anything
to get the child giggling about something that used to be too scary
even to think about.</p>
<p>people don't learn best when they are humiliated. Taking on the fear
myself seemed to unstick the fear</p>
<p>little bit, like putting oil on a rusty hinge</p>
<p>I have seen many parents allow fears like this to go unchecked
forever, limiting the child's activities, out of an effort to protect
them from</p>
<p>feeling scared if they are forced to face the scary thing again. Other
parents ignore the fear, forcing the child to sink or swim. Playful
Parenting provides a middle ground, a more effective solution than
either of these</p>
<p>Naturally, it involves a playful attitude and attention to closeness
and confidence</p>
<p>reverse the roles, to be the incompetent one who can't swing. I find
that it is often better to play at being incompetent instead of
pretending to be fearful, since that seems to let the child loosen up
and laugh about</p>
<p>it more</p>
<p>So, you say, “I am the best swinger ever, no swing is too tough for
me, I know everything there is to know about swings,” and then you act
as if you can't tell the difference between a swing and a slide. Or
you can't even get on it properly. Or you fall off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hopefully, the child is laughing his head off, and/or
giving you</p>
<p>instructions on how to do it properly, which, of course, you bungle</p>
<p>As always, be on the lookout for signs the child is feeling teased or
made fun of, and if this seems to be the case, apologize and switch
gears right away</p>
<p>we are going to work on <em>getting over the fear of swings</em>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's no big deal to be afraid of swings, but who needs a life
filled with restrictions like that? On the other hand, if you say,
“You're going on the swing and that's</p>
<p>final. If you cry about it, you're never going to the park again,”
you may win the battle, but you're on the way to losing the war.
Children who end up being reckless daredevils—mostly boys—have buried
their fear and have to continually prove to themselves that they
aren't afraid, so they do increasingly dumb things</p>
<p>The middle ground is to mention casually that you want to help him get
over his fear of swings</p>
<p>You have become the director and stage manager, overriding his
avoidance of swings, but not so much that he freezes up or shuts all
systems down.</p>
<p>At the right distance—which may be just outside your front door or
twenty yards from the</p>
<p>swing or right beside them—there is an invisible boundary that
represents exactly the border between avoiding the fear and being
flooded by it</p>
<p>This is the edge (it may not always be at the same place even for the
same child). This is where the work of using Playful Parenting to heal
fears takes place. At this edge, when you say, brightly, “Let's</p>
<p>go on the swing,” the child's response may be trembling or screaming
or laughing</p>
<p>They may burst into tears, or break out in a cold sweat. That's the
signal you're at the edge. That's good! Don't panic. Listen to the
feelings, but don't force them forward or let them give up. Just keep
relaxedly saying, “Let's go on the swing. Let's go</p>
<p>one step closer. How about if we touch the swing?</p>
<p>The child has to trust that you won't trick him and make him get on
before he is ready</p>
<p>Be prepared. This may take a few minutes or a few hours, and it may
all happen at one sitting or over the course of several playtimes.
Gradually, you inch toward the goal, with lots of encouragement</p>
<p>scream breaks. Pause the movie and give a pretend scream, which will
usually be followed by giggles.</p>
<p>This break lets some of the feelings out, like the valve on a pressure
cooker</p>
<p>If children are having trouble with friends, try simply saying,
“Let's pretend that we're friends.” See what happens</p>
<p>With one young boy, I made up a game called Larry's School of
Nonsense and Goofiness, because he never would have wanted to go along
if I had said, “Let's play kindergarten</p>
<p>for example, “I hate you,” or “You're stupid.” The parent feels
outraged or rejected. But the children are not going to curl into your
lap and cry, “No one likes me,” even though that's what they really
mean. We have to read between the lines and understand that they are
telling us</p>
<p>we might say, “Waaah, Joey called me stupid. Waaah, no one likes me.”
Or, “You can call me stupid, but you'd better not call me Wiener
Schnitzel.”</p>
<p>Once a fantasy game has</p>
<p>started, play your part with gusto, and thicken the plot</p>
<p>hurting other people isn't helpful, but playing at it can be both fun
and educational—in the sense of learning to manage aggressive feelings
and impulses.</p>
<p>Their own imagination is overpowered by the intensity and the
repetition of what they see on the screen</p>
<p>some children will get creative even with the most uninspiring toys,
but often it takes some adult help to get the play unstuck from the
same exact characters, scenarios, and outcomes</p>
<p>Most toys are junk, by which I mean they can do only one thing, over
and over. Great toys, like good dramatic play, allow children to make
the world their own and allow full expression of their creativity.</p>
<p>you can't successfully ban games based on TV shows, especially war
play or weapon play. You can try to ban it, but they are very likely
to become obsessed with the idea of it, because it is forbidden</p>
<p>they <em>need</em> to play these games in order to figure out what those</p>
<p>images and stories mean to them</p>
<p>By playing with them, we can help children rediscover their own
stories, their own characters, their own source of imaginative play</p>
<p>Pretend to be wounded and see if you can get the child to be a
nurturing medic for a minute instead of a soldier or superhero</p>
<p>In the same way that toy guns can inhibit children's creative play,
graphic images of sex and</p>
<p>violence can overwhelm children's imaginations. These images replace
children's own creations, the ones they come up with in their own
minds</p>
<p>with a mass-produced and overly stimulating imitation</p>
<p>Watch TV and movies with them, and stop to discuss the things you see.
Play games based on what you've watched, but twist things around a
bit</p>
<p>Play the</p>
<p>role of the cheerful idiot who is entranced with Power Rangers, or who
tries to imitate the dancers in heavy-metal rock videos</p>
<p>Through billions of dollars in marketing, the corporations of the
world write a master script for our children, with one and only one
role for them to play: the consumer</p>
<p>my daughter saw a video at a children's museum about truth versus
deception in television advertisements aimed at</p>
<p>children</p>
<p>Ever since, she has been wisely skeptical about claims made in
commercials</p>
<p>This is another type of role reversal</p>
<p>The media aimed at children are so much more exciting and enticing
than we'll ever be. So children tune us out, and we respond by tuning
them out</p>
<p>David Elkind, famous for his book <em>The Hurried Child</em></p>
<p>talks about the way this</p>
<p>media-driven consumerism affects our children</p>
<p>What characterizes contemporary capitalistic societies, particularly
the United States, is the exploitation of children as consumers. Toy
and clothing manufacturers and the music and movie industries now view
children and youth as a vast market.</p>
<p>Because of the way girls tend to be</p>
<p>inhibited from exploring, they need help in spreading their wings,
exploring the wide world, and discovering their own power room.
Because boys are so often left alone with their feelings and deprived
of the comforts of cuddling and nurturing, they need extra help in
putting down roots.</p>
<p>If the adults thought the child was a girl, they went to get her
sooner when she cried, and they interacted with her more. If they
thought it was a boy, they waited much longer to comfort the</p>
<p>crying baby, but they encouraged more exploration and more gross motor
activity</p>
<p>no wonder that later on, boys are more likely to be punished while
girls are more likely to be overprotected</p>
<p>Girls are comforted, but are not usually encouraged to explore or take
risks; they need Playful Parenting that builds empowerment and
confidence. Boys are allowed to explore and are actively encouraged to
be daring, but they are left alone when they are scared or lonely or
sad</p>
<p>as they get older, they are not just left alone but punished for
expressing these feelings</p>
<p>When I talk to groups of adults, I often ask what annoys or aggravates
or bewilders them about boys. It is no wonder that the answers,
especially</p>
<p>from women, come back loud and clear: “They don't talk.” “They're
closed up.” “They don't share how they feel.” The answer is simple:
connect, connect, connect. Do it as playfully as possible, but do it.
For girls, the answer is just as straightforward: empower, empower,
empower</p>
<p>Let's work it out together.”</p>
<p><em>Inborn sex differences are real, but they are quite small</em>.4</p>
<p>Parenting, culture, and education can either minimize or exaggerate
these small biological differences. In our society they tend to be
exaggerated.</p>
<p>girls who engaged in more stereotypical feminine play as young
children did worse than other girls in math and science in school.5</p>
<p>We can only speculate about the long-term effects on boys of being
limited to certain toys.</p>
<p>unrealistic and distorted expectations about how girls should look,
and about what is pretty, lock many girls into a fortress of
powerlessness</p>
<p>Mary Pipher, author of <em>Reviving Ophelia</em>, talks about how girls
experience a significant drop in self-esteem within minutes of
thumbing through fashion magazines</p>
<p>If your daughter reads those magazines, go through them with her.
Don't let the images play</p>
<p>out their seductive games without some input from you, some grounding
in reality</p>
<p>How can engaging in play help your daughter be empowered? If you sit
on the floor and play Barbies with her, you can shake things up a bit.
Be wild with the dolls: dance them around, dress them up oddly, make
them say outrageous things</p>
<p>I like having one doll play up the sexist stereotypes that the dolls
are based on, while another more powerful doll stands up to it. “I'm
the femininity police, and you aren't being ladylike!” “Shut up and
leave me alone; I like to run and jump, and you can't stop me.” I</p>
<p>try to introduce plots that are different from the love</p>
<p>and romance and marriage scenarios that are the staple of
girl-oriented games and movies</p>
<p>encourage girls to be adventurous, loud, strong, physically powerful,
and assertive. We need to fight the notion that strong women and girls
are not proper females</p>
<p>This may require, especially for mothers, that we take a close look at
our own</p>
<p>upbringing, and our own inhibitions about wrestling or
rough-and-tumble play</p>
<p>All children can use a hand with being more confident and being
powerful in a healthy and constructive way</p>
<p>I insert a little reality into the play here and there</p>
<p>Ouch, that must hurt!”—and I insert as much closeness as possible. I
fall over dead on top of them if I get shot, cower behind them if an
enemy is nearby, take any excuse to be physically and emotionally
close.</p>
<p>With both boys and girls, the Playful Parenting approach is to join in
first, then gradually lead them out of the spot where they</p>
<p>are stuck</p>
<p>If we lecture them, or refuse to play a game because it is too violent
or too girly, they shut us out</p>
<p>We wouldn't like it if someone told us our favorite activities were
stupid.</p>
<p>If we leave them alone to figure out all this confusing stuff about
being male or being female, they really aren't being left alone at
all</p>
<p>if we leave the scene, they are told how to behave and how to look and
what to think by marketing departments, advertising agencies, and the
entertainment industry</p>
<p>Competition is an area that is confusing for</p>
<p>both girls and boys, and for their parents. Girls may give up on
trying their hardest, or may not be able to enjoy a victory, because
they feel bad for the losers. Boys, meanwhile, are expected to care
more about winning than about friendships or feelings</p>
<p>Boys are supposed to sacrifice relationships and emotions in favor of
competition and victory, while girls are supposed to sacrifice
individual achievement in favor of not hurting anyone's feelings</p>
<p>Boys use teasing, and even hitting, as a way of being close to one
another, especially since more direct ways of expressing affection are
forbidden to boys after age three or four</p>
<p>the answer is somewhere in between</p>
<p>With our help, boys can be as well connected as they are powerful, and
girls can be as empowered as they are connected</p>
<p>Help them learn to draw more interesting things. Draw together to help
them out of the lonely corner where the stereotyped drawings repeat in
an endless loop.</p>
<p>Exaggerating or playing with these differences also helps loosen
things up. “Aw, you drew a love battleship; how cute. All those guns
poking out of it are so</p>
<p>precious….” “Oh no! That rainbow shot me with a heart dart; I'm
bleeding.”</p>
<p>Since most boys have been pressured not to cry, or have gotten in
trouble with their peers for crying, I made up a character called
Never-Cry-Man. I say, with a dramatic flourish, “I am Never-Cry-Man; I
never cry,” and then I burst into fake</p>
<p>tears at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>With girls I will play a character who is a parody of girliness, who
lives and breathes for fashion and hair design</p>
<p>Or I play the role of a handsome prince who cares only about what the
girl dolls look like. He's a very funny sexist pig who provokes
laughter</p>
<p>and lets girls reject the timeworn stereotypes</p>
<p>games loosen up the absurd images that the media try to lock into our
children's brains.</p>
<p>boys face extra obstacles in reconnecting. Because of how boys are
treated, they are more likely to have difficulty expressing feelings,
showing that they've been hurt, looking vulnerable, maintaining
intimate</p>
<p>relationships, and giving or accepting tenderness</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these are exactly the ways to get out of that tower of
isolation</p>
<p>Their empty cups weren't the result of negligent parenting but of our
society's mistreatment of boys</p>
<p>playing more with our sons isn't the only answer, but it is a
significant start.</p>
<p>The starting place is <em>emotional connection</em>. Empathy, emotional
intelligence, kindness</p>
<p>some of the things that would help boys connect are considered “girl
things”: cuddling; playing with baby dolls; reading and writing
poetry; practicing music, art, literature, drama, singing, dancing.
Some boys do these things, but they are much more common and much more
encouraged in</p>
<p>girls</p>
<p>Some of these activities focus on communication. In order to help boys
to talk more, play simple word games and language games.</p>
<p><em>fortunately/unfortunately</em>, where one person starts a story with,
“Fortunately…” and the other person says the next line, starting with</p>
<p>Unfortunately…” You go back and forth telling a tale of disaster and
rescue</p>
<p>two important themes for most children</p>
<p>Another great game, which doesn't require words, is squiggle</p>
<p>One person starts a drawing, making squiggles that</p>
<p>don't look like anything in particular. The other person has to
finish the drawing, making it into something. You take turns being the
one to start. The idea of these play activities is to practice the
building blocks of communication</p>
<p>Don't expect to leapfrog directly to deep conversations</p>
<p>parents recently</p>
<p>who were eager for their nine-year-old son to talk to them more. I
suggested ways for them to listen to him on his turf—nonverbal
communication</p>
<p>So rather than insisting that he tell them details about his school
day, they asked him to give it a thumbs-up or thumbs-down</p>
<p>He loved that, and started adding more elaborate gestures</p>
<p>A former</p>
<p>power struggle became a cherished family ritual</p>
<p>I took off my coat and covered up the screen with it</p>
<p>You are so good at this, I bet you can do it without looking.” He was
excited by this idea, and I told him I'd tell him which direction his
enemy was and what was happening on the screen</p>
<p>to help boys connect, you can play anything at all, especially games
that require some interaction. Even better, play what they want to
play. You can't communicate the idea that what they want to play is
stupid and violent and antisocial, and then expect them to talk to you</p>
<p>about their inner feelings</p>
<p>Another set of games focuses directly on emotions. Make a facial
expression, or find some good ones in a magazine, and play <em>name that
feeling</em></p>
<p>Ask them to make a scary face, a sad face, a scared face. Respond with
a complementary face (that is, comfort the sad face, recoil in horror</p>
<p>from the angry face</p>
<p>Get into fantasy play with them, and have your character express
feelings through words and actions. Don't be subtle. Boys usually
love it when a grown man pretends to cry in an exaggerated way</p>
<p>Boys in our society are famous for having problems with paying
attention and sitting still</p>
<p>many attention problems in boys are really <em>attachment</em> problems</p>
<p>They have more to do with the boy's cup being empty or leaky than
they do with any inability to process information</p>
<p>No one can process information properly or pay attention</p>
<p>well if they don't have the secure base of good attachment</p>
<p>Stanley Greenspan writes: “The active, energetic child soon learns to
seek in stimulation the satisfaction he cannot find in intimacy.</p>
<p>all that racing around makes him hard to be close to. Thus, the
impulsivity and scattered quality of some boys</p>
<p>diagnosed with ADD may simply be a side effect of a deeper problem, an
inability to connect</p>
<p>My favorite tactic with teenage girls is to say, “Okay, your turn.”</p>
<p>I tell them that they can talk about anything they want, or we can go
anywhere they want. Then I wait.</p>
<p>Powerlessness in boys often masquerades as</p>
<p>strength, because boys have to look tough and strong, no matter how
they feel inside</p>
<p>With crying girls they were more likely to give comfort; with crying
boys they were more likely to scold</p>
<p>game called the designated screamer. This game is designed to help
children who stoically tough it out when they get hurt</p>
<p>started jumping up and down, pretending that <em>my</em> leg was in extreme
agony. He asked me what I was doing</p>
<p>and I explained that I was the designated screamer</p>
<p>She wanted to see if I would follow her lead, and once I did, she
could see I was on her side. Then she was ready to connect and do
something fun together.</p>
<p>When you are “listening” to a child's play, you have to treat
<em>everything</em> as if it's communication, including throws and kicks of
a football</p>
<p>saying yes to whatever they want to do and setting aside specific
occasions for what I call PlayTime</p>
<p>HOW TO FOLLOW A CHILD'S LEAD</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Just say yes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do whatever they want to do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be safe (but don't worry too much)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set aside PlayTime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take time to recover</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>JUST SAY YES</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>ollowing a child's lead means that every once in a while (as
often as we can handle it), children</p>
<p>need us to be hugely enthusiastic, to say yes in a booming voice
instead of the constant parade of no</p>
<p>jumping in does not help them</p>
<p>develop their own good judgment. They simply have to discover certain
things for themselves, and the best way for them to do this is with
our encouragement and support</p>
<p>try breaking out of the automatic habit of saying no all the time</p>
<p>If they suggest something ridiculously dangerous, and you respond with
an enthusiastic, “Hey, that's a cool idea, let's try it,” <em>they</em>
will probably say, “No! That's dangerous.” If</p>
<p>they suggest something that is harmless but seems impossible, try not
to jump in and say so. Try saying, “Great idea. I</p>
<p>wonder how we could make that work.” They just might figure it out, to
your surprise, and at the very least they will think it through for
themselves.</p>
<p>Saying <em>yes</em> instead of <em>no</em> does not mean hiding how you feel. Saying
yes to something doesn't mean you have to pretend to like it! If you
hate a certain game, it is okay to say you</p>
<p>hate it, but instead of just saying, “No, I won't play that with
you,” try humorously begging and pleading not to have to play it.</p>
<p>Just saying yes means having a basic attitude of acceptance rather
than rejection, approval</p>
<p>rather than disapproval</p>
<p>Be animated as you play: use gestures, your voice, and facial
expressions. Be enthusiastic, racing after the ball if you're playing
catch, throwing yourself into your character in fantasy play. Be sure
to take stock of your own feelings, especially</p>
<p>depression and anger, since these emotions make it hard to match
children's pace and tone</p>
<p>Be warm, inviting, supportive. Now, I don't expect you to do this
every minute you are with children; it would be nice, but it's a
little unrealistic</p>
<p>set aside</p>
<p>certain times to really try on this attitude, even if it's just for a
few minutes at first</p>
<p>hours of half hearted, lethargic, resentful interaction is less
helpful</p>
<p>that a shorter time of full-throttle play</p>
<p>once they get some of this type of playtime, they will usually be less
demanding of every minute of your attention the rest of the time</p>
<p>But most situations in life aren't so drastic that children can't be
allowed to figure them out on their own. It's like doing children's
homework for them: the answers may be right, but they haven't learned
anything</p>
<p>instead of saying</p>
<p>That won't work,” try saying “Let's try it and see.”</p>
<p>they will see you as an ally instead of a naysayer</p>
<p>look inside to see if you are saying no out of your own feelings of
discomfort or because it is really necessary</p>
<p>Patty Wipfler</p>
<p>I recommend her writings</p>
<p>very highly</p>
<p>Following children's leads and doing whatever they want to do are the
cornerstones of what she calls Special Time</p>
<p>The times when we can relax, play and connect with our children are at
the heart of our precious relationship with them. But relaxed time for</p>
<p>parent and child to share their love is always in short supply….
‘Special time' is an excellent tool… an active form of listening, in
which your child's play becomes her vehicle for telling you about her
life….”2</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when we say, “I don't want to play,” they hear that
as, “I don't want to join you in your world.</p>
<p>No wonder they then</p>
<p>say to us, “I don't want to go to school…. I don't want to go to
Aunt Margaret's….” They are just saying they don't want to go to our
world either. The more we join them in their world, the more
cooperative they'll be when we drag them along to ours</p>
<p>And we can't just sit there like a lump while they play, either, much
as we'd like to after a hard day. They need us to be active
participants in the play, just like listening requires active
attentiveness. We don't share our innermost selves with people who
stare out into space</p>
<p>while they are talking to us, or look constantly at their watch, or
keep changing the subject. It can be a challenge to be an active
participant in play, while still following their lead</p>
<p>the more we let them take the lead, the more children have room to try
out new things. These new things might be</p>
<p>physical challenges, like finally trying the monkey bars or the high
diving board, or they may be emotional challenges, like asking someone
to be their friend or talking about a bad experience in school</p>
<p>SET ASIDE PLAYTIME</p>
<p>set aside an hour or two where the child is completely in charge</p>
<p>The parent or some other adult sets aside regular <em>one-on-one</em> time
with a child. The adult offers the child <em>undivided attention</em> with
<em>no interruptions</em> and with a clear <em>focus on connection</em>,
<em>engagement, and interaction</em></p>
<p>more enthusiasm, more joining, more commitment to closeness and
confidence, more fun, a more welcoming attitude toward their feelings,
more willingness to put one's own feelings aside, more active and
boisterous play</p>
<p>set</p>
<p>aside specific time and calling</p>
<p>it PlayTime</p>
<p>You might, in fact, just want to start with ten or fifteen minutes</p>
<p>each child has regular one-on-one PlayTime with a parent</p>
<p>his fantasy games are always about aggressive dinosaurs, be a dinosaur
that gets hurt and ask the child's dinosaur for help. Even if he
refuses, you are at least starting a dialogue about dependency and
empathy, not just about aggression</p>
<p>Rule-breaking is a good theme to</p>
<p>introduce for most children. I love to</p>
<p>make up wacky rules and then pretend to be upset when children break
them, or have them make up rules for me—with appropriate punishments</p>
<p>exclusion and inclusion</p>
<p>wanting to be included by the group, but they are all too willing to
exclude others. We can't just order children to be nice and then walk
away. We have to stick around and help children figure out the actual
nuts and bolts of including and</p>
<p>what to do when children exclude or feel like excluding.7</p>
<p>Having the child's dolls or stuffed animals act out exclusion and
rejection is my favorite way to introduce this theme</p>
<p>Birthday party lists are <em>not</em> a time to empower children; they are a
time to guide them, especially when it comes to exclusion based on
race or class, or exclusion of a scapegoat or outcast</p>
<p>Children also need to be pushed to overcome</p>
<p>their resistance to differences of any kind</p>
<p>The idea is to get the child giggling about the whole issue rather
than to give a thinly disguised lecture. It may seem funny, but those
giggles actually help the</p>
<p>child think better about the topic</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>aking the lead in play also means having an attitude that
anything can be fun. Chores</p>
<p>errands, cleanup, drudgery—why shouldn't these be as fun-filled as
playing?</p>
<p>bribes backfire, making it even less likely that children will want to
do something on their own initiative</p>
<p>three key themes lurking underneath every wild rumpus:
<em>dependence-independence</em>, <em>aggression</em>, <em>and sex</em>.</p>
<p>different version of disconnection. They can't</p>
<p>connect with anyone but mom, or with anyone new, or with their peers</p>
<p>A very different Playful Parenting approach to excess dependency is to
reverse the roles so that you grab on to children and cling to <em>them</em>
for dear life. Children who cling are used to being sent away, and
they dread it</p>
<p>When we are the ones who cling, letting them be the ones eventually to
squirm away from us, they can notice the connection instead of
focusing on the separation</p>
<p>she could never relax because she knew</p>
<p>that as soon as she fell asleep I would leave</p>
<p>if we cling to them, <em>they</em> can be in charge of when to separate</p>
<p>They need to balance all their new accomplishments with some extra
closeness</p>
<p>any increase in expectations or responsibility should be accompanied
by an increase in playtime together</p>
<p>If your four-year-old climbs into the baby carriage when the toddler</p>
<p>climbs out, say in a delighted voice, “What a marvelously enormous
baby! I've never seen anything like it. Goo-goo-goo baby.” When the
child talks, exclaim how amazing it is that a tiny baby can talk. Soon
he'll get out of the carriage and show how he can run, jump, etc</p>
<p>His cup</p>
<p>gets filled by the brief excursion into babyhood</p>
<p>We have to protect them, but we also have to let them spread their
wings a little</p>
<p>Sometimes all we need to do is relax and not hover so much, trusting
that they will be safe enough, even if we can't guarantee 100 percent
safety.</p>
<p>Other times we just need to find safe</p>
<p>ways for them to practice their independence</p>
<p>We can also loosen up about things like mess, noise, and bathroom
humor, if those things bother us. Power struggles disappear if we
don't fight over them</p>
<p>let them make more of their own decisions</p>
<p>Most children love games that let them make and break silly rules. So
invent a rule—like no giggling or no blinking—and then make a big</p>
<p>pretend fuss when they break the rule. This gives them a chance to
giggle about an area of their life that is very challenging</p>
<p>Sometimes children will want to use their PlayTime to be completely in
charge of the rules. They may want you to follow the rules exactly, or
they</p>
<p>may want you to break the rules and be punished</p>
<p>Adult involvement is crucial here, because other children will never
allow your child to have so much power. When children try to control
the rules with one another, it doesn't usually go over very well</p>
<p>parenting goes much smoother if we cheerfully obey orders during
PlayTime. It helps them cheerfully follow our rules at other times.</p>
<p>Emma's Rules Monopoly</p>
<p>she asked me if she could make up some rules</p>
<p>On the contrary, being in charge of the play and the rules fills
children's cup—and that refill then leaves them more able to play
happily on a level playing</p>
<p>field with their peers</p>
<p>helps them play out their tensions and upsets about the confusing
world of games, rules, and competition</p>
<p>We can help this process along by exaggerating (in a funny way) the
thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.</p>
<p>Just to make it more confusing, sometimes children have their cup
filled by <em>not</em> being given a special break. Sometimes they like to be
treated as one of the big kids or one of the grown-ups, and to have to
play their hardest to keep up.</p>
<p>have conversations about sex, answering their questions simply and
honestly, and to reduce their exposure to provocative movies,
television, or nudity at home</p>
<p>Some</p>
<p>children have no trouble with mild nudity or sexual material; others
are disturbed by it.</p>
<p>the parents were worried about their six-year-old daughter's frequent
masturbation. I thought they were handling it very well. They didn't</p>
<p>freak out or punish her or forbid it. They asked her to do it in her
room and not when other people were around.</p>
<p>We want them to know that it's okay to be curious, to not know
something, to be scared and confused.</p>
<p>Any kind of physical play, from playing sports to wrestling to running
around outside, can help children dissipate their excess sexual energy</p>
<p><strong>S</strong>ometime when things are going smoothly, and you have slightly
more attention to spare</p>
<p>than usual, invite your child to do the things you can't stand</p>
<p>If your children are driving you nuts with their sibling rivalry, for
example, ask them: “Could you guys please have a fight?”</p>
<p>Or tease each other, or take things from each other, or fight over who
gets your attention, or complain about who got a bigger piece of tofu,
or whatever drives you crazy.) “Would you do that for me? I'll watch
and take notes.” Usually they won't actually do what you ask, but if
they do, just pretend to be a news reporter. Watch</p>
<p>with great interest, ask questions, ask them to</p>
<p>do it again so you can study it</p>
<p>The idea of inviting behavior that you hate is that it gives the
difficult situation a playful twist. This twist usually lets the adult
think better about how actually to handle the situation, and it
catches children off their guard. “Instead of</p>
<p>taking the garbage out tonight, could you sit like a lump in front of
the TV for a few hours?” “I'm in the mood for a big argument about
what time bedtime is tonight; what about you?” The invitation is a way
of following children, since you are responding to their usual
behavior, but</p>
<p>it is also a way of leading, because you are turning the whole family
dynamic upside down</p>
<p>If children start being obnoxious before you</p>
<p>have a chance to invite it, you can still play this game. “Hey, I see
you guys are fighting! Can I watch?</p>
<p>You can provide a running commentary, a play-by-play, about</p>
<p>whatever it is they are doing</p>
<p>The play-by-play narration can also be a good way to express what we
are thinking and feeling in a playful way. So often we either hold
everything in or we scream it all out. Neither of those is very
satisfying—or very effective. Try expressing yourself playfully
instead:</p>
<p>If emotions are not expressed freely, either the emotion is locked
away, creating all kinds of problems as children grow up, or the
emotion leaks out in indirect ways</p>
<p>Many people will do <em>anything</em> to get the crying to stop: bribe,
threaten, tease, plead, scold, send the child away, give in to
unreasonable demands. If we just accept the feelings and let them
flow, they don't cause half as much fuss</p>
<p>Some children won't tell the story on their own, so we need to ask
them. Then, since the story is</p>
<p>probably very short, we can ask them to tell it again. Most children
love that; it signals that we really care about what happened to them</p>
<p>when you repeat a story over and over, it loses its sting</p>
<p>If the child is too young to tell the story, or doesn't want to, you
can try telling it to</p>
<p>them</p>
<p>I recommend that parents not send their children to their rooms to cry
alone, or leave them alone to cry themselves to sleep</p>
<p>It is more time-consuming</p>
<p>to stay with them, to help them let out their feelings of loneliness
and sadness, but those feelings don't just go away because we shut
the door on them</p>
<p>I am starting to see eight-, nine-, and ten-year-olds in my practice
whose parents followed the advice to “let them</p>
<p>cry it out” when the children were babies. These infants were seen as
manipulating parents into cuddling with them or lying down with them
to sleep. These children now are having trouble sleeping through the
night because of fears, nightmares, and worries</p>
<p>parents are sometimes too overwhelmed with their own feelings of loss
to be very helpful to the children. In both of these circumstances, it
helps to have other adults available for</p>
<p>children to talk to and play with—adults who aren't involved in the
family emotions.</p>
<p>If your child throws tantrums, go ahead and answer the italicized
questions yourself.</p>
<p>What do you think the child is trying to express through the tantrums?</p>
<p>After a tantrum, is your child happier, more relaxed, confident,
connected, cooperative, or engaged?</p>
<p>If they can't express their frustration, or if they are</p>
<p>punished for having a tantrum, it continues to interfere with their
happiness, their ability to cooperate, or their achievements.</p>
<p>sometimes all we need to do is let one or two tantrums run their
natural course, all the way to completion, with no attempts to
interrupt it</p>
<p>Then the children may stop throwing tantrums because they finally feel
as if they have</p>
<p>really been heard</p>
<p>staying near the child instead of sending him away or leaving him
alone or pestering him with questions and solutions</p>
<p>remain emotionally available even while firm in their position of
denying something, tantrums can also teach a child that he will not be
left alone in his ‘dark night of the soul.</p>
<p>What is the family's usual reaction or</p>
<p>response to the tantrum?</p>
<p>try not to say no if you aren't willing to stand by it just because
of a tantrum</p>
<p>tantrums may help us realize that we didn't have a very good reason
for saying no</p>
<p>we don't want to give in to the tantrum. We need to be willing to
change our minds if our no was unreasonable</p>
<p>Children in the midst of a tantrum are flooded with feelings, and they
feel out of control. They need a loving human being</p>
<p>near them—maybe not within kicking range(!), but close by</p>
<p>We may need to step outside and take a break first, to cool off, but
then we need to show them that their having strong feelings does not
isolate them from the community of</p>
<p>civilized people. We want children to learn that nothing inside of
them is too awful to be shared with us, not even overwhelming feelings
of frustration.</p>
<p>children may be stuck in a cycle of tantrums, hoping against hope that
<em>next time</em> someone will listen to them or stick with them. Instead,
all that happens is the family gets more and more annoyed and hostile</p>
<p>The other alternative</p>
<p>is even more disastrous: Children learn the lesson that they're all
alone in this life, it truly is a cold cruel world, and you can't
count on anyone when the going gets rough. They retreat into a
completely sealed-off tower of isolation</p>
<p>So stay</p>
<p>engaged with children, even when they are full of tough feelings.</p>
<p>What have you tried to do to end the tantrums?</p>
<p>also helps parents see that they often keep doing the same thing over
and over, even though it never helps. The</p>
<p>My favorite tantrum preventer involves jumping in playfully when you
see things beginning to get out of hand. I'll say things like, “One
of us needs to scream. Shall I, or do you want to?” Or, “Everyone's
starting to get a little frustrated, let's have a giggle</p>
<p>fest.” A giggle-fest is when everyone pretends to laugh until they are
really laughing. Or, “I challenge you to a thumb-wrestling match to
determine the championship of the world.”</p>
<p>Is there a pattern to the tantrums</p>
<p>During PlayTimes, make up funny nos and let children play with these</p>
<p>pretend limits. With a young girl named Johanna, I make up silly rules
constantly. No giggling! No standing on both feet! No breathing! When
she breaks the rule, I pretend to be so mad I can't see straight, so,
of course, I fall over trying to catch her</p>
<p>author Patty Wipfler</p>
<p>when children have felt endangered and helpless, they direct their
reaction—usually anger and mistrust—toward the people closest to them</p>
<p>We need to help</p>
<p>children develop <em>courage</em>, not fearlessness. <em>Confidence</em>, not
toughness</p>
<p>You have to feel fear in order to be brave, otherwise you're just
reckless and thrill-seeking</p>
<p>You also have to push yourself to do what you're afraid to do;
otherwise you will never try new things</p>
<p>When children are reckless, they need someone to play with them, to
climb trees with them, in order to provide a calming influence and a
model of safe adventurousness. When children are shy and inhibited,
they need</p>
<p>to be drawn out of their shell, again through play. They may need us
to go down the slide with them a few times before they feel
comfortable joining up with the other children at the playground. Most
shy children don't do very well with the typical sink-or-swim</p>
<p>approach. But they are not well served by just letting them stay home
or in the corner forever, either.</p>
<p>Artistic expression is one of the best ways to release anxiety or
fear, whether it is by singing, drawing, dancing, sculpting, or
writing. “Give that tight knot in your throat a voice</p>
<p>a good</p>
<p>cry actually <em>fills</em> children's cups, especially if they are being
held and comforted.</p>
<p>“What</p>
<p>do you think the child is trying to express? Are they happier and more
connected with you after a cry? Do you go into gyrations to get them
to stop: begging, pleading, threatening, bribing, sending them away?
If so, what happens then? Is there a pattern in your family</p>
<p>of teasing people or humiliating them for crying? Have they ever seen
you cry? Have you tried staying with them, physically and emotionally,
listening to them cry for as long as it takes to express themselves
fully?”</p>
<p>If I limit myself to one piece of advice to adults about children's
crying, it is this: Please</p>
<p>do not send them off alone to cry. Tears can be a tremendous
opportunity for strengthening a connection between any two people, but
especially between parent and child</p>
<p>There is nothing as satisfying as the feeling of a baby falling
comfortably asleep on your chest after a big fuss. If you always cut
the tears short, or hand the baby over to someone else when she cries,
you never have this wonderful experience.</p>
<p>One sign that tears are related to connection</p>
<p>is what I call peeking out. Someone who has</p>
<p>been crying hard, or having a tantrum, or digging their face into your
shoulder to avoid eye contact, will occasionally peek out. It's a
wonderful thing to see. If children have been crying hard for a while,
they will often peek out, make eye contact, and then, seeing a loving</p>
<p>relaxed adult, will go right back to the tears</p>
<p>They aren't sad to see you, but they <em>are</em> reassured that they are
safe, which means it is okay to cry. Eventually</p>
<p>the best response to fake tears is playfulness. “Hey, I think you're
faking it. That makes me so sad, waaah!” “I'm not fooled</p>
<p>by those fake tears, but I'll play a game with you if you want.”</p>
<p>presumptuous for us to decide which tears to be compassionate about
and which ones to dismiss</p>
<p>Since we usually stop tears before they are done, some children get
stuck in an endless loop of trying to express their feelings through
tears, only to be stopped midway</p>
<p>whining</p>
<p>said, “You know, that kind of voice is like brakes, like putting on</p>
<p>the brakes of a car. It actually makes you go slower and makes it
harder to climb</p>
<p>There's another kind of talking that's like putting on the gas.” And
I proceeded to use my cheeriest voice, saying “I can do it; no big old
rocks are going to stop me. I don't care how tired I am</p>
<p>Oh, a refueling stop! Great. Let's have some water and raisins. This
is a gas break, not a brake break</p>
<p>why moaning and complaining doesn't really help much, and why using a
powerful or cheerful voice does help</p>
<p><em>choosing</em> to be positive and upbeat instead</p>
<p>of miserable, even if you <em>feel</em> like whining</p>
<p>persistent encouragement: “I know you can do it. Don't give up. You
are a great artist; give it one more try. I'm confident you'll get
it.</p>
<p>Keep being calmly confident, without exerting any pressure</p>
<p>Emotional competence means that children have developed from the stage
of acting out their emotions, to expressing them through</p>
<p>play, and ultimately to verbalizing them</p>
<p>We can help children along in this development by asking them what</p>
<p>they are feeling, asking what they think other people might be
feeling, or asking about their doll's emotions.</p>
<p>they need to learn how to play out the feelings</p>
<p>ask them to draw their feeling, or make up a story about it, or do a
dance that expresses it</p>
<p>saying, “Show me with these two puppets what happened and how you
felt.</p>
<p>pretend to have a feeling that children are having trouble expressing</p>
<p>model the safe release of that feeling: “I am so</p>
<p>mad! I am going to punch this pillow.”</p>
<p>exaggerate an emotion they are denying they have: “Waaah… I'm so
scared I'm going to faint…. Grrrr, I am so mad I could spit</p>
<p>When one child hits another, or says something mean, I often say,
“Ouch, that hurt,</p>
<p>game</p>
<p><em>emotional hot potato</em>. The one rule is you try to pass unwanted
feelings on to someone else</p>
<p>There are many terrible things in this world. But the worst is when a
child is</p>
<p><em>afraid of his father, mother or teacher. He fears them, instead of
loving and trusting them.”</em></p>

<p>closeness, playfulness, and emotional understanding are better bets
than punishment, behavior modification, and too</p>
<p>much permissiveness.</p>

<p>a problem, count to ten, take a break, wait a few hours for things to

<p><strong>A FRESH LOOK AT DISCIPLINE</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Know your child</p>

<li>
<p>Set clear limits</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Talking to other parents is one of the best ways to cool off</p>
<p>If you don't have anyone you can call, and you feel</p>
<p>that things are getting out of hand, Parents Anonymous
(<a href="https://www.parentsainonymous-natl.org" rel="external" target="_blank">www.parentsainonymous-natl.org</a>) is a great organization that can help</p>
<p>So instead of punishment, which tends to create an even bigger
disconnection between parent and child, try thinking about how to
reestablish a connection</p>
<p>The rule is that if someone calls a meeting on the couch, the other
person has to show up for the meeting. Once you are both at the couch,
anything may happen.</p>
<p>You might talk seriously about what has been going on, or you may not
even talk about it, just</p>
<p>take the chance to reconnect</p>
<p>Try to stay on the couch until both of you are ready to go back</p>
<p>and do things differently from before</p>
<p>about meetings on the couch is that they are not just for misbehavior.
You can call a meeting if you notice your child is sad or blue, or if
you have both been irritable lately</p>
<p>The best way to make discipline more connecting is to think <em>We</em> have
a problem instead of <em>My kid</em> is misbehaving</p>
<p>The main problem with time-outs is that they</p>
<p>enforce isolation on children who are probably already feeling
isolated and disconnected</p>
<p>If someone is looking for</p>
<p>attention that bad, I figure <em>they must need some attention</em>! If we
give them enough of the good kind, they won't be so desperate that
they'll settle for the bad kind.</p>
<p>These children want and need contact, they are afraid of separation,
and they see time-outs, or being sent to their room, as banishment.
They will create more trouble</p>
<p>resisting time-out than they were causing in the first place.</p>
<p>Children may need to hear a louder tone in our voice, or to feel a</p>
<p>hand on their shoulder, or to see us look right in their eyes, in
order to tune in to us. Remember, the goal is to get their attention
in order to make a connection, not to scare them or show them who's
boss. If we focus on getting their attention, we can probably think of
more</p>
<p>effective ways than yelling or threatening or hurting them</p>
<p>Edwin Markham, which A. S. Neill quotes in the beginning of his book
<em>Freedom—Not License!</em>:</p>
<p>Are you having battles with your children over bedtime? Play bedtime.
Having battles over dessert? Play dinnertime</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter if you play a mean mother who says no
dessert, or if you play an absurdly nice mother</p>
<p>who says “We're having ice cream for dinner tonight.” Whatever makes
them laugh. Having trouble with back talk? Pick up two dolls, and have
one talk back to the other. You'll have fun imitating children's
obnoxious behavior and making up snappy comebacks</p>
<p>If you're having trouble with rules, make up a rule you don't really
care about, and play at making, breaking, and punishing that rule</p>
<p>Instead of one more round of “You have to get dressed, right now,” try
saying “There's only one rule: You can't wear</p>
<p>one red shoe and one black shoe!”</p>
<p>the essence of discipline is to <em>teach</em></p>
<p>I think parents avoid playfulness in difficult parenting situations
because they are afraid of rewarding bad behavior. <em>I have to remain
stern and angry and cold so he'll know he did wrong</em></p>
<p>** But being playful is not about rewards or punishments, it is about
restoring the missing ingredient—connection—that caused the problems
in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>I</strong>nstead of trying to get children to be obedient, I recommend that
we strive for them</p>
<p>to have good judgment. Obedience lasts only as long as we are in the
room with them. It does not help a child know what to do in a
brand-new situation.</p>
<p>Good judgment, on the other hand, comes from talking with children,
brainstorming about how they might handle different situations, and</p>
<p>discussing moral dilemmas.</p>
<p>We have to be on the same wavelength with our children before we can
have these types of conversations, so connect first. Connecting with
children after they've done something wrong, listening to how they
feel about it, and telling them calmly how</p>
<p>we feel, all do much more to instill good judgment than punishment
does.</p>
<p>Children develop into thoughtful, considerate, honest, and kind adults
because of love and affection, because of high moral standards, and
because of a close relationship</p>
<p>with someone who models those values. I have never seen anyone
punished into being good. Bribes don't work either. Promises,
threats, rewards, and punishments have been called “the most primitive
way of dealing with human beings.”4</p>
<p>try to find the need or the feeling underneath every behavior that
bugs you</p>
<p><em>Here Are Some Common Translations That Fit Many Problem Situations:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You're bored? You must be feeling lonely. Let's play a game, or we
can invite someone over.</li>
</ul>
<p>^</p>
<p>I can see you're starting to get discouraged, so I am going to give
you encouragement.</p>
<p>You and I haven't had much time together, so maybe that's why
you've been so annoying. Let's do something</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>special.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You seem sad, so I am going to comfort you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need more room to run around and get some energy off. Let's
go outside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You seem mad, so I am going to hold a big pillow so you can whack
it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You've been trying to get my attention all day, in all kinds of ways,
so I'm going to put down my book for ten minutes and give you my
undivided attention.</p>
<p>You seem too fidgety to sit still. Let's</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>dance!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You seem overwhelmed. I am going to help you calm down. Let's
take three deep breaths together.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You've been really nasty toward your brother lately. What's the
matter? I'd like</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to hear about what's bothering you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You seem cranky and irritable. Let's have a snack and see if that
helps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a lot of our discipline is just acting out <em>our</em> feelings</p>
<p>harshness and coldness from us</p>
<p>just leads to isolation and powerlessness from them</p>
<p>So make eye contact, talk softly, hold them as gently as possible,
take a breather if you're too hot under the collar.</p>
<p>The more playtime you have with your children, especially play where
they get to be in charge and you help them maintain their closeness
and confidence, the less you will need any of these</p>
<p>alternatives to punishment</p>
<p>punishments don't usually work very well. They just cause resentment
and strife without helping children develop a stronger sense of</p>
<p>morality</p>
<p>you may well find that children can't handle having their own TV,
can't get their homework done if they have access to the phone after
school, can't control the time they spend online, and so on. Setting
limits in these areas is not punishment, it's parenting</p>
<p>Children need limits, guidance, and structure. These need to be
applied lovingly and in a relaxed manner, not in anger or revenge</p>
<p>we can set limits and have high expectations for children while still
having empathy for their feelings and compassion for their needs</p>
<p>understand the difference between children's real needs and their
unrealistic wish to be the complete center of</p>
<p>the universe</p>
<p>The true cause of spoiling is giving in to children <em>against our
better judgment</em>.</p>
<p>The strict parent ignores children's ability to make their own
decisions. The permissive parent ignores children's need to be a
contributing part of the</p>
<p>family</p>
<p>All children benefit from high expectations, especially the
expectation to be a moral person and to pull their weight in the
family</p>
<p>If limits are given lovingly and respectfully, they provide structure
and safety, and, hence, security</p>
<p>Stay engaged, knowing that the limit will provide children with an
opportunity to be sad or mad. If the limit was reasonable, don't give
up the limit because of this emotional reaction. Just listen.</p>
<p>All children need to hear nos that are loving and gentle, not just
angry or explosive.</p>
<p>We have to save our no for when we really mean it, and then follow
through firmly. That might mean physically restraining children from
hitting their younger sibling. It might mean sitting down with them
and watching them finish their</p>
<p>homework. It definitely means that we don't tell them what to do and
then walk away and never notice if they did it or not.</p>
<p>Empty threats, which are not followed through on, can be especially
anxiety-arousing for children. We may know we would never</p>
<p>leave them in the grocery store, but children aren't sure. Saying,
“Stop, stop, stop, please stop,” in a timid voice, also conveys a
confusing message to children. They aren't going to want to reward
that behavior by stopping! They count on <em>us</em> to keep them in check
until they</p>
<p>can do it themselves, and that kind of weak pleading implies that we
can't provide this safety net for them.</p>
<p>Some families bounce back and forth between indulgence and punishment.
The result is random and unpredictable. The limit might be stated
twenty times, for example</p>
<p>with no effect and no weight behind it. Suddenly the parent is
furiously screaming: “I told you twenty times it was time to go!” Yes,
but the first nineteen didn't count, and the child knew it.</p>
<p>Punishment, ineffective discipline, and too</p>
<p>much indulgence send children to the towers of isolation and
powerlessness</p>
<p>Playful Parenting and the discipline alternatives that flow from it
lead children out of these towers. The single most important thing to
remember is that everyone needs a full cup of closeness and</p>
<p>connection. Everyone.</p>
<p>Children need to get into arguments to learn</p>
<p>how to resolve them; they must be excluded from groups to learn play
group entry skills. They must play with disagreeable peers and bullies
to broaden their repertoire of social strategies. They must have play
ideas rejected so they can learn to become persuasive</p>
<p>When</p>
<p>adults intervene too quickly in conflict, these opportunities are lost</p>
<p><em>Stand back, but with your eyes open</em>.</p>
<p><em>Step in, but with a light touch</em>, not a hammer</p>
<p>stay engaged, while still letting the children be mostly in charge.</p>
<p>Ask them questions, but let them propose the solutions. Be interested,
but not overly worried.</p>
<p>two children, there is fighting—over a toy, the remote control, or who
got the bigger piece of pie. My favorite</p>
<p>response to this kind of conflict, whether it is between siblings or
playmates, is to grab the toy and run</p>
<p>The two children then bond together to try to get it away from me</p>
<p>I don't do that all the time, since they also need to figure out how
to negotiate with each other</p>
<p>If they are hitting each other, I'll say, “Bet you can't hit <em>me</em>,”
and then run out of the room, pretending to be scared</p>
<p>the best types of play are</p>
<p>universal and inclusive. Play based on TV shows or computer games is
much less inclusive</p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he image of the empty cup (see page 43) is useful to keep in mind
when thinking about siblings. The most typical manifestation of
sibling rivalry is competition for those refills. Older siblings watch
the baby get perpetual fill-ups, just for burping and farting and
looking cute. Meanwhile, they look at their own cup and</p>
<p>it seems as if the level is always on low</p>
<p>Even worse, nobody seems to care, except to scold them or punish them,
which empties their cup even more</p>
<p>Later on, the younger one may feel as if the older one gets all the
refills—a later bedtime, more privileges, a real bike</p>
<p>much sibling conflict can be seen as trying to steal a refill from the
other child's cup</p>
<p>we fill those cups the</p>
<p>same way as we do it one-on-one: with attention, love, affection,
listening, and (of course!) snacks</p>
<p>show older siblings how to let younger siblings be in charge of the
play sometimes</p>
<p>The older one can feel important and competent, and at the same time
can symbolically work through the key issues by “pretending” to be
weaker or slower than the younger child.</p>
<p><em>Offer a solution.</em> We are the parents, and we know our children very
well. Sometimes all we need to do is offer a solution to resolve the
conflict. “Go outside… take a break from each other… let's invite a
friend over for each of you</p>
<p>let's wrestle… let's have snack time</p>
<p><em>Give encouragement and inspire their confidence.</em> In</p>
<p>let them know that we truly believe <em>they</em> can figure out a solution
that is right for everyone, instead</p>
<p>of suggesting that we don't trust them to find a good answer
themselves</p>
<p>say things like, “I'm sure you guys can work this out. Anyone have
any ideas?” “I'm not sure what the right solution is, but I bet there
is one. Let's all keep thinking about it.” “Everyone has to</p>
<p>be included. How are you going to manage that?” “We can't keep
playing if you guys can't stop hurting each other. I have complete
confidence that you can figure out a way to keep the game nonviolent.”
“This isn't working. Everyone</p>
<p>is fighting over turns and nobody is getting to play. What can we do
so everybody gets a turn?”</p>
<p>Another example of a half solution is to say, “Mark is really upset
about this; what are you guys going to do to make it right?” instead
of the more typical, “Say you're</p>
<p>sorry,” or “It was an accident; he didn't mean it.” There is nothing
that irritates me more than children's halfhearted, insincere apology
just to get their mom or dad off their back. Yet I see parents falling
for it all the time</p>
<p>Flood children with love and affection</p>
<p>** Sometimes that's all we need to do. If we fill their cups in the
most basic way—a hug, a cuddle, a story, a kind word, some special
time together, their favorite foods—they will figure out the rest</p>
<p>Children also have a need to <em>give</em> love and affection, not just
receive it. In addition to loving us, they can play out this need with
baby dolls, younger</p>
<p>siblings, friends, or pets. Boys, unfortunately, are less likely to
get much chance at this loving and nurturing, except, perhaps, with
pets</p>
<p>Protect</p>
<p>provide them is protection from undue harm</p>
<p>We can't</p>
<p>protect our chil dren from every bump and bruise and emotional injury,
and we shouldn't try</p>
<p>make sure children are not scapegoated or abused or terrorized.</p>
<p>helps them feel safe</p>
<p>When children feel safe, they are able to get along much better with
one another, and to play more happily and freely.</p>
<p>In a program called Protective Behaviors, children are taught that
they have the right to be safe; others have the right to be safe with
them; there</p>
<p>is nothing so terrible that you can't tell someone about it; and you
can keep searching until someone listens</p>
<p>Provide perspective</p>
<p>Sometimes, magically, all we have to do is point out each person's
position in a relaxed tone of voice. “You want the ball because it's
yours, and he wants it because he's never had a turn to play with</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>Simply listening and reflecting may give them all they need</p>
<p>Promote win-win outcomes</p>
<p>Be playful</p>
<p>Imagine if you took all the time you now spend fussing at siblings to
stop fighting, and you spent it playing with them</p>
<p>Give up the search for perfect equality</p>
<p>** Give each child what they need, rather than attempting to be equal.</p>
<p>Focus instead on</p>
<p>the feelings of not being loved enough</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>efore we can really use any parenting advice, I think we need to
recharge ourselves</p>
<p>refill our own empty cups, listen to each other, and come out of our
own towers of isolation and powerlessness.</p>
<p>The first step to recharging our own batteries is to acknowledge the
emotions we feel when we start to play—feelings like boredom,
frustration, resentment, anger, annoyance, anxiety, fatigue,
distraction, and a sense of being overwhelmed</p>
<p>The basic method of getting our own cup filled is pretty simple: Find
someone who will listen to you. It might be a spouse, another parent,
a friend, or a therapist</p>
<p>We may need to train our listeners to listen without interrupting, and
to listen without</p>
<p>telling us what we should do and how we should feel. If it isn't a
paid listener, we also need to take a turn listening to them</p>
<p><em>There is plenty of good listening available if people take turns</em></p>
<p>Talking (and all the emotions we release when we honestly share our
thoughts and feelings) is the adult equivalent of play</p>
<p>It's how we show what's really going on inside of us, and how we get
back to ourselves.</p>
<p>part of why parents seem so tired all the time is that we carry around
a hidden pile of worries, embarrassments, secret feelings of being a
bad</p>
<p>parent, helplessness, and other painful emotions</p>
<p>Good listening means taking turns, respecting confidentiality, and
allowing the other person to say <em>anything at all</em> without fear of
being judged or rejected</p>
<p>Don't interrupt, and don't say, “Me, too,” then launch into your own
story</p>
<p>Here is a list of questions to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What do you remember from when you were the ages your children are
now?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do those memories help you</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>understand where things get hard now as a parent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are your hopes and dreams for your children? Are these
realistic? Have you left room for your child to figure out his or
her own hopes and dreams?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all know from TV and magazines what parenting is <em>supposed</em> to
be like, but what is parenting really like for you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is great about being a parent? What is great about you as a
parent? What are some of your shining moments as a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's hard about being a parent? What are you too embarrassed
about or ashamed of ever to tell anyone</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping these things buried inside of us just makes it more likely
that we will make the same mistakes over and over again</p>
<p>fun play refills cups, ours as well as our children's. The play
itself is rejuvenating, but the</p>
<p>real refill comes from the connection that grows out of the play</p>
<p>We may have to push ourselves at first, especially to play whatever
children want to play, but the payoff is worth it.</p>
<p>have fun, and keep reaching for a connection with your children. They
do not</p>
<p>need us to be perfect—but they do notice when we <em>try</em>.</p>
<p>A play-day is a few hours when some children, their parents, and other
adults get together to play. Generally there are at least two adults
per child. That allows some of the adults to go off and take turns
listening to each other, while the rest play with the children</p>
<p>adults make a special effort to be playful and enthusiastic, and to
follow the children's lead</p>
<p>In a family workshop, that same basic format goes on for a whole
weekend. Part of that time, children have special one-on-one time with
a parent or</p>
<p>another adult to do whatever they want, as I described in chapter nine</p>
<p>idea of adult play groups, where adults can get together to reclaim
playfulness as a valuable part of life. At these events, it usually
takes the adults a while to loosen up and</p>
<p>actually play. There is also time for talking about the joys and
difficulties of parenting, and for expressing the frustrations, fears,
and anger that parents don't want to express directly to children.</p>

let anybody tell you any different!”</p>
