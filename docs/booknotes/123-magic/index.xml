    <title>123 Magic (4/10) :: Linux Reader</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/booknotes/123-magic/</link>
    <description>Don’t argue with your kids. Manage behavior without getting angry. This was an exciting method at first but became un-managable. Focuses too much on last resort when all other methods fail. Instead of focusing on the all other methods. Very easy to use “breaks” and rewards to try and manipulate your child instead of teaching lessons and trying to get activities to be enjoyable in and of themselves. Read Playful Parenting instead.</description>
