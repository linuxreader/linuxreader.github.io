    <description>Whether you are using sticky tabs, highlighters, or pencils to mark your favorite passages from books. Or just swiping your finger to highlight and exporting your highlights. All of this takes time and energy away from reading.&#xA;The only benefit is that you have something to go back to later if you want to review important parts from books.&#xA;But, going back to highlights and reviewing them also takes time. And I would rather just re-read a book that is worth re-reading.</description>
