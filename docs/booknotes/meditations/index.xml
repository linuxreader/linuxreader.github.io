    <title>Meditations (9/10) :: Linux Reader</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/booknotes/meditations/</link>
    <description>I enjoyed reading this more than I thought I would. The emperor spent a great deal thinking about what it means to be human, philosophy, on life, on dying, and how best to navigate the world. Both the internal world of the mind and soul, and the external world of matter and other people.&#xA;This book makes me want to keep a better journaling habit. And study philosophy. And not worry about things that do not matter. Because we all become dust in the end anyway.</description>
