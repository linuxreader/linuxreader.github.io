<p>I enjoyed reading this more than I thought I would. The emperor spent a great deal thinking about what it means to be human, philosophy, on life, on dying, and how best to navigate the world. Both the internal world of the mind and soul, and the external world of matter and other people.</p>
<p>This book makes me want to keep a better journaling habit. And study philosophy. And not worry about things that do not matter. Because we all become dust in the end anyway.</p>
<p>Marcus Aurellius also cut through what does matter. Such as service to others. Speaking truthfully. Not letting your situation bother you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary-and-highlights">Summary and Highlights</h2>
<p>Self-control and resistance to distractions.</p>
<p>Optimism in adversity—especially illness.</p>
<p>That I had someone—as a ruler and as a father—who could keep me from being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live without a troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture—the whole charade. That you can behave almost like an
ordinary person without seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out official obligations.</p>
<p>Remember how long you’ve been putting this off, how many extensions
the gods gave you, and you didn’t use them. At some point you have to
recognize what world it is that you belong to; what power rules it and
from what source you spring; that there is a limit to the time
assigned you, and if you don’t use it to free yourself it will be gone
and will never return.</p>
<p>Do external things distract you? Then make time for yourself to
learn something worthwhile; stop letting yourself be pulled in all
directions. But make sure you guard against the other kind of
confusion. People who labor all their lives but have no purpose to
direct every thought and impulse toward are wasting their time—even
when hard at work.</p>
<p>Not just that every day more of our life is used up and less and
less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure
our mind will still be up to understanding the world—to the
contemplation that aims at divine and human knowledge? If our mind
starts to wander, we’ll still go on breathing, go on eating, imagining
things, feeling urges and so on. But getting the most out of
ourselves, calculating where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and
see, deciding whether it’s time to call it quits—all the things you
need a healthy mind for … all those are gone.</p>
<p>So we need to hurry.</p>
<p>Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our
understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get there.</p>
<p>You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything
random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important
or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that
if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at
once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And
it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were
straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish
person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence
generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else
you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking.</p>
<p>What is it—this thing that now forces itself on my notice? What is it
made up of? How long was it designed to last? And what qualities do I
need to bring to bear on it—tranquillity, courage, honesty,
trustworthiness, straightforwardness, independence or what?</p>
<p>People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to
the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic:
you can get away from it anytime you like.</p>
<p>By going within.</p>
<p>Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than
your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An
instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by
tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.</p>
<p>So keep getting away from it all—like that. Renew yourself. But keep
it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all
and send you back ready to face what awaits you.</p>
<p>What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into
consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>that rational beings exist for one another;</li>
<li>that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;</li>
<li>that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;</li>
<li>and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and
fought and died and been buried.</li>
</ul>
<p>“If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do
what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the
requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.</p>
<p>Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can
eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask
yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?”</p>
<p>But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate
the unnecessary actions that follow.</p>
<p>Words once in common use now sound archaic. And the names of the
famous dead as well: Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus … Scipio and
Cato … Augustus … Hadrian and Antoninus, and …</p>
<p>Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion
covers it.</p>
<p>And those are the ones who shone. The rest—“unknown, unasked-for” a
minute after death. What is “eternal” fame? Emptiness.</p>
<p>Then what should we work for?</p>
<p>Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A
resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing
like water from that same source and spring.</p>
<p>Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The
knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what
exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of
what will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the ones that
make plants or children? Go deeper.</p>
<p>On the verge of dying and still weighed down, still turbulent,
still convinced external things can harm you, still rude to other
people, still not acknowledging the truth: that wisdom is justice.</p>
<p>So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain:
the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is
great good fortune.</p>
<p>A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of
the list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they
gain by dying old? In the end, they all sleep six feet under—
Caedicianus, Fabius, Julian, Lepidus, and all the rest. They buried
their contemporaries, and were buried in turn.</p>
<p>Our lifetime is so brief. And to live it out in these circumstances,
among these people, in this body? Nothing to get excited about.
Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of
life or three generations: what’s the difference?</p>
<p>No one could ever accuse you of being quick-witted.</p>
<p>All right, but there are plenty of other things you can’t claim you
“haven’t got in you.” Practice the virtues you can show: honesty,
gravity, endurance, austerity, resignation, abstinence, patience,
sincerity, moderation, seriousness, high-mindedness. Don’t you see how
much you have to offer—beyond excuses like “can’t”? And yet you still
settle for less.</p>
<p>Or is it some inborn condition that makes you whiny and grasping and
obsequious, makes you complain about your body and curry favor and
show off and leaves you so turbulent inside?</p>
<p>No. You could have broken free a long way back. And then you would
have been only a little slow. “Not so quick on the uptake.”</p>
<p>And you need to work on that as well—that slowness. Not something to
be ignored, let alone to prize.</p>
<p>Not to feel exasperated, or defeated, or despondent because your
days aren’t packed with wise and moral actions. But to get back up
when you fail, to celebrate behaving like a human—however
imperfectly—and fully embrace the pursuit that you’ve embarked on.</p>
<p>Things have no hold on the soul. They have no access to it, cannot
move or direct it. It is moved and directed by itself alone. It takes
the things before it and interprets them as it sees fit.</p>
<p>In a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do
them good and put up with them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are
now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the
“what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations.
Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past
and future gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see.</p>
<p>So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any
indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.</p>
<p>Soon you’ll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most—and even that
is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale,
and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other. Quarreling children—laughing
and then bursting into tears a moment later. Trust, shame, justice,
truth—“ gone from the earth and only found in heaven.”</p>
<p>Why are you still here? Sensory objects are shifting and unstable; our
senses dim and easily deceived; the soul itself a decoction of the
blood; fame in a world like this is worthless.</p>
<p>—And so?</p>
<p>Wait for it patiently—annihilation or metamorphosis.</p>
<p>—And until that time comes—what?</p>
<p>Honor and revere the gods, treat human beings as they deserve, be
tolerant with others and strict with yourself. Remember, nothing
belongs to you but your flesh and blood—and nothing else is under your
control.</p>
<p>You can lead an untroubled life provided you can grow, can think
and act systematically.</p>
<p>Two characteristics shared by gods and men (and every rational
creature):</p>
<p>i. Not to let others hold you back.</p>
<p>ii. To locate goodness in thinking and doing the right thing, and to
limit your desires to that.</p>
<p>Not to be overwhelmed by what you imagine, but just do what you
can and should. And if &lt;…&gt; suffer in inessentials, not to treat
that as a defeat. (Bad habit.)</p>
<p>Like the old man asking for the orphan’s toy on the way out—even
though he knew that’s all it was. Like that</p>
<p>I was once a fortunate man but at some point fortune abandoned me.</p>
<p>But true good fortune is what you make for yourself. Good fortune:
good character, good intentions, and good actions.</p>
<p>To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind.</p>
<p>Only there, delight and stillness.</p>
<p>When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to
yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll
have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.</p>
<p>Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and
suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or
that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep
wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love—something rubbing
against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid.</p>
<p>Perceptions like that—latching onto things and piercing through them,
so we see what they really are. That’s what we need to do all the
time—all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust—to lay
them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend
that encrusts them.</p>
<p>Pride is a master of deception: when you think you’re occupied in the
weightiest business, that’s when he has you in his spell.</p>
<p>(Compare Crates on Xenocrates.)</p>
<p>Some things are rushing into existence, others out of it. Some of
what now exists is already gone. Change and flux constantly remake the
world, just as the incessant progression of time remakes eternity.</p>
<p>We find ourselves in a river. Which of the things around us should we
value when none of them can offer a firm foothold?</p>
<p>Like an attachment to a sparrow: we glimpse it and it’s gone.</p>
<p>And life itself: like the decoction of blood, the drawing in of air.
We expel the power of breathing we drew in at birth (just yesterday or
the day before), breathing it out like the air we exhale at each
moment.</p>
<p>The way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries,
the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by
Posterity—people they’ve never met and never will—that’s what they set
their hearts on. You might as well be upset at not being a hero to
your great-grandfather.</p>
<p>Not to assume it’s impossible because you find it hard. But to
recognize that if it’s humanly possible, you can do it too.</p>
<p>In the ring, our opponents can gouge us with their nails or butt
us with their heads and leave a bruise, but we don’t denounce them for
it or get upset with them or regard them from then on as violent
types. We just keep an eye on them after that. Not out of hatred or
suspicion. Just keeping a friendly distance.</p>
<p>We need to do that in other areas. We need to excuse what our sparring
partners do, and just keep our distance—without suspicion or hatred.</p>
<p>Death. The end of sense-perception, of being controlled by our
emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our bodies.</p>
<p>To escape imperialization—that indelible stain. It happens. Make
sure you remain straightforward, upright, reverent, serious,
unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind, affectionate, and doing
your duty with a will. Fight to be the person philosophy tried to make
you.</p>
<p>Revere the gods; watch over human beings. Our lives are short. The
only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and
unselfish acts.</p>
<p>You take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or
“bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things happen, or the “good”
ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people
responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad
behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited
“good” and “bad” to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge
God, or to treat other people as enemies.</p>
<p>Does the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or Asclepius Demeter’s?
And what about each of the stars—different, yet working in common?</p>
<p>The only thing that isn’t worthless: to live this life out truthfully
and rightly. And be patient with those who don’t.</p>
<p>When you need encouragement, think of the qualities the people
around you have: this one’s energy, that one’s modesty, another’s
generosity, and so on. Nothing is as encouraging as when virtues are
visibly embodied in the people around us, when we’re practically
showered with them.</p>
<p>It’s good to keep this in mind.</p>
<p>It doesn’t bother you that you weigh only x or y pounds and not
three hundred. Why should it bother you that you have only x or y
years to live and not more? You accept the limits placed on your body.
Accept those placed on your time.</p>
<p>Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or
do.</p>
<p>Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that happen to you.</p>
<p>Sanity means tying it to your own actions.</p>
<p>Practice really hearing what people say. Do your best to get
inside their minds.</p>
<p>You cannot quench understanding unless you put out the insights that
compose it. But you can rekindle those at will, like glowing coals. I
can control my thoughts as necessary; then how can I be troubled? What
is outside my mind means nothing to it. Absorb that lesson and your
feet stand firm.</p>
<p>You can return to life. Look at things as you did before. And life
returns.</p>
<p>No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like
gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone
says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”</p>
<p>To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is
uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re
human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and
that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they
haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to
choose.</p>
<p>Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have,
the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if
you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction
that you start to overvalue them—that it would upset you to lose them.</p>
<p>“ Then the only proper response for me to make is this: ‘You are
much mistaken, my friend, if you think that any man worth his salt
cares about the risk of death and doesn’t concentrate on this alone:
whether what he’s doing is right or wrong, and his behavior a good
man’s or a bad one’s.’ ”</p>
<p>Look at the past—empire succeeding empire—and from that,
extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from the rhythm of
events.</p>
<p>Which is why observing life for forty years is as good as a thousand.
Would you really see anything new?</p>
<p>Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:</p>
<ul>
<li>to accept this event with humility</li>
<li>to treat this person as he should be treated</li>
<li>to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational
creeps in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of yourself as dead. You have lived your life. Now take
what’s left and live it properly.</p>
<p>And this too: you don’t need much to live happily. And just because
you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist,
don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving
others, obeying God.</p>
<p>To live life in peace, immune to all compulsion. Let them scream
whatever they want. Let animals dismember this soft flesh that covers
you. How would any of that stop you from keeping your mind
calm—reliably sizing up what’s around you—and ready to make good use
of whatever happens? So that Judgment can look the event in the eye
and say, “This is what you really are, regardless of what you may look
like.” While Adaptability adds, “You’re just what I was looking for.”
Because to me the present is a chance for the exercise of rational
virtue—civic virtue—in short, the art that men share with gods. Both
treat whatever happens as wholly natural; not novel or hard to deal
with, but familiar and easily handled.</p>
<p>The gods live forever and yet they don’t seem annoyed at having to
put up with human beings and their behavior throughout eternity. And
not only put up with but actively care for them.</p>
<p>And you—on the verge of death—you still refuse to care for them,
although you’re one of them yourself.</p>
<p>If it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone
else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.</p>
<p>Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the
damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming
people get you?</p>
<p>No pointless actions.</p>
<p>What dies doesn’t vanish. It stays here in the world, transformed,
dissolved, as parts of the world, and of you. Which are transformed in
turn—without grumbling.</p>
<p>Everything is here for a purpose, from horses to vine shoots.
What’s surprising about that? Even the sun will tell you, “I have a
purpose,” and the other gods as well. And why were you born? For
pleasure? See if that answer will stand up to questioning.</p>
<p>Joy for humans lies in human actions.</p>
<p>Human actions: kindness to others, contempt for the senses, the
interrogation of appearances, observation of nature and of events in
nature.</p>
<p>Three relationships:</p>
<p>i. with the body you inhabit;
ii. with the divine, the cause of everything in all things;
iii. with the people around you.</p>
<p>Either pain affects the body (which is the body’s problem) or it
affects the soul. But the soul can choose not to be affected,
preserving its own serenity, its own tranquillity. All our decisions,
urges, desires, aversions lie within. No evil can touch them.</p>
<p>You have to assemble your life yourself—action by action. And be
satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can
keep that from happening.</p>
<p>—But there are external obstacles.…</p>
<p>Not to behaving with justice, self-control, and good sense.</p>
<p>—Well, but perhaps to some more concrete action.</p>
<p>But if you accept the obstacle and work with what you’re given, an
alternative will present itself—another piece of what you’re trying to
assemble. Action by action.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated head,
just lying somewhere far away from the body it belonged to …? That’s
what we do to ourselves—or try to—when we rebel against what happens
to us, when we segregate ourselves. Or when we do something selfish.</p>
<p>You have torn yourself away from unity—your natural state, one you
were born to share in. Now you’ve cut yourself off from it.</p>
<p>But you have one advantage here: you can reattach yourself. A
privilege God has granted to no other part of no other whole—to be
separated, cut away, and reunited. But look how he’s singled us out.
He’s allowed us not to be broken off in the first place, and when we
are he’s allowed us to return, to graft ourselves back on, and take up
our old position once again: part of a whole.</p>
<p>We have various abilities, present in all rational creatures as in
the nature of rationality itself. And this is one of them. Just as
nature takes every obstacle, every impediment, and works around
it—turns it to its purposes, incorporates it into itself—so, too, a
rational being can turn each setback into raw material and use it to
achieve its goal.</p>
<p>Don’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don’t
try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with
the situation at hand, and ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t
I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer.</p>
<p>Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only
the present—and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits.
And if your mind tries to claim that it can’t hold out against that
 … well, then, heap shame upon it.</p>
<p>Stop perceiving the pain you imagine and you’ll remain completely
unaffected.</p>
<p>—“You?”</p>
<p>Your logos .</p>
<p>—But I’m not just logos .</p>
<p>Fine. Just don’t let the logos be injured. If anything else is, let it
decide that for itself.</p>
<p>For animate beings, “harmful” is whatever obstructs the operation
of their senses—or the fulfillment of what they intend. Similar
obstructions constitute harm to plants. So too for rational creatures,
anything that obstructs the operation of the mind is harmful.</p>
<p>Apply this to yourself.</p>
<p>Do pain and pleasure have their hooks in you? Let the senses deal with
it. Are there obstacles to your action? If you failed to reckon with
the possibility, then that would harm you, as a rational being. But if
you use common sense, you haven’t been harmed or even obstructed. No
one can obstruct the operations of the mind. Nothing can get at
them—not fire or steel, not tyrants, not abuse—nothing. As long as
it’s “ a sphere … in perfect stillness.”</p>
<p>I have no right to do myself an injury. Have I ever injured anyone
else if I could avoid it?</p>
<p>People find pleasure in different ways. I find it in keeping my
mind clear. In not turning away from people or the things that happen
to them. In accepting and welcoming everything I see. In treating each
thing as it deserves.</p>
<p>Lift me up and hurl me. Wherever you will. My spirit will be
gracious to me there—gracious and satisfied—as long as its existence
and actions match its nature.</p>
<p>Is there any reason why my soul should suffer and be
degraded—miserable, tense, huddled, frightened? How could there be?</p>
<p>External things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them.
Which you can erase right now.</p>
<p>If the problem is something in your own character, who’s stopping you
from setting your mind straight?</p>
<p>And if it’s that you’re not doing something you think you should be,
why not just do it?</p>
<p>—But there are insuperable obstacles.</p>
<p>Then it’s not a problem. The cause of your inaction lies outside you.</p>
<p>—But how can I go on living with that undone?</p>
<p>Then depart, with a good conscience, as if you’d done it, embracing
the obstacles too.</p>
<p>Nothing but what you get from first impressions. That someone has
insulted you, for instance. That—but not that it’s done you any harm.
The fact that my son is sick—that I can see. But “that he might die of
it,” no. Stick with first impressions. Don’t extrapolate. And nothing
can happen to you.</p>
<p>Or extrapolate. From a knowledge of all that can happen in the world.</p>
<p>No carelessness in your actions. No confusion in your words. No
imprecision in your thoughts. No retreating into your own soul, or
trying to escape it. No overactivity.</p>
<p>They kill you, cut you with knives, shower you with curses. And that
somehow cuts your mind off from clearness, and sanity, and
self-control, and justice?</p>
<p>A man standing by a spring of clear, sweet water and cursing it. While
the fresh water keeps on bubbling up. He can shovel mud into it, or
dung, and the stream will carry it away, wash itself clean, remain
unstained.</p>
<p>To have that. Not a cistern but a perpetual spring.</p>
<p>How? By working to win your freedom. Hour by hour. Through patience,
honesty, humility.</p>
<p>Not to know what the world is is to be ignorant of where you are.</p>
<p>Not to know why it’s here is to be ignorant of who you are. And what
it is.</p>
<p>Not to know any of this is to be ignorant of why you’re here.</p>
<p>And what are we to make of anyone who cares about the applause of such
people, who don’t know where or who they are?</p>
<p>You want praise from people who kick themselves every fifteen
minutes, the approval of people who despise themselves. (Is it a sign
of self-respect to regret nearly everything you do?)</p>
<p>The existence of evil does not harm the world. And an individual
act of evil does not harm the victim. Only one person is harmed by
it—and he can stop being harmed as soon as he decides to.</p>
<p>Other people’s wills are as independent of mine as their breath
and bodies. We may exist for the sake of one another, but our will
rules its own domain. Otherwise the harm they do would cause harm to
me. Which is not what God intended—for my happiness to rest with
someone else.</p>
<p>We speak of the sun’s light as “pouring down on us,” as “pouring
over us” in all directions. Yet it’s never poured out. Because it
doesn’t really pour; it extends. Its beams (aktai ) get their name
from their extension (ekteinesthai ).</p>
<p>To see the nature of a sunbeam, look at light as it falls through a
narrow opening into a dark room. It extends in a straight line,
striking any solid object that stands in its way and blocks the space
beyond it. There it remains—not vanishing, or falling away.</p>
<p>That’s what the outpouring—the diffusion—of thought should be like:
not emptied out, but extended. And not striking at obstacles with fury
and violence, or falling away before them, but holding its ground and
illuminating what receives it.</p>
<p>What doesn’t transmit light creates its own darkness.</p>
<p>To enter others’ minds and let them enter yours.</p>
<p>Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings
for each other’s sake: to help—not harm—one another, as they deserve.
To transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of
the gods.</p>
<p>And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the
nature of that which is. And that which is and that which is the case
are closely linked, so that nature is synonymous with Truth—the source
of all true things. To lie deliberately is to blaspheme—the liar
commits deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without
realizing it. Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of
nature—its order. He is in conflict with the way the world is
structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is opposed to the
truth—even against his will. Nature gave him the resources to
distinguish between true and false. And he neglected them, and now
can’t tell the difference.</p>
<p>And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil—that too is
blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound to find himself constantly
reproaching nature—complaining that it doesn’t treat the good and bad
as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the things
that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things that
produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s
bound to happen, the world being what it is—and that again is
blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly avoid
wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.</p>
<p>Some things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one over the
other it would hardly have created both. And if we want to follow
nature, to be of one mind with it, we need to share its indifference.
To privilege pleasure over pain—life over death, fame over
anonymity—is clearly blasphemous. Nature certainly doesn’t.</p>
<p>And when I say that nature is indifferent to them, I mean that they
happen indifferently, at different times, to the things that exist and
the things that come into being after them, through some ancient
decree of Providence—the decree by which from some initial starting
point it embarked on the creation that we know, by laying down the
principles of what was to come and determining the generative forces:
existence and change, and their successive stages.</p>
<p>Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the
things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and
maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like
sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes
at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.</p>
<p>So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with
indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply
viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate
the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should
await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of
your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to
death: the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind
of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel
resentment toward them—in fact, you should look out for their
well-being, and be gentle with them—but keep in mind that everything
you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s
all that could restrain us (if anything could)—the only thing that
could make</p>
<p>us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our
vision. But now? Look how tiring it is—this cacophony we live in.
Enough to make you say to death, “Come quickly. Before I start to
forget myself, like them.”</p>
<p>To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do
yourself an injustice—it degrades you.</p>
<p>And you can also commit injustice by doing nothing.</p>
<p>Objective judgment, now, at this very moment.</p>
<p>Unselfish action, now, at this very moment.</p>
<p>Willing acceptance—now, at this very moment—of all external events.</p>
<p>That’s all you need.</p>
<p>All things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a thing
exists. All earthly things feel the earth’s tug. All wet things flow
together. And airy things as well, so they have to be forcibly
prevented from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn upward by that higher
fire, but ready to ignite at the slightest touch of other, earthly
flame. So that anything drier than usual makes good fuel, because less
of what hinders combustion is mixed in with it.</p>
<p>And things that share an intelligent nature are just as prone to seek
out what is like them. If not more so. Because their superiority in
other ways is matched by their greater readiness to mix and mingle
with their counterparts.</p>
<p>Even in irrational beings we see swarms and herds, and nesting, and
love not unlike ours. Because they do have souls, and the bonding
instinct is found in a developed form—not something we see in plants,
or stones, or trees. And it’s still more developed in rational beings,
with their states, friendships, families, groups, their treaties and
truces. And in those yet</p>
<p>more developed there is a kind of unity even between separate things,
the kind that we see in the stars. An advanced level of development
can produce a sympathy even in things that are quite distinct.</p>
<p>Things wait outside us, hover at the door. They keep to
themselves. Ask them who they are and they don’t know, they can give
no account of themselves.</p>
<p>What accounts for them?</p>
<p>The mind does.</p>
<p>Leave other people’s mistakes where they lie.</p>
<p>When we cease from activity, or follow a thought to its
conclusion, it’s a kind of death. And it doesn’t harm us. Think about
your life: childhood, boyhood, youth, old age. Every transformation a
kind of dying. Was that so terrible?</p>
<p>Think about life with your grandfather, your mother, your adopted
father. Realize how many other deaths and transformations and endings
there have been and ask yourself: Was that so terrible?</p>
<p>Then neither will the close of your life be—its ending and
transformation.</p>
<p>You participate in a society by your existence. Then participate
in its life through your actions—all your actions. Any action not
directed toward a social end (directly or indirectly) is a disturbance
to your life, an obstacle to wholeness, a source of dissension. Like
the man in the Assembly—a faction to himself, always out of step with
the majority.</p>
<p>Endless suffering—all from not allowing the mind to do its job.
Enough.</p>
<p>Do what nature demands. Get a move on—if you have it in you—and don’t
worry whether anyone will give you credit for it. And don’t go
expecting Plato’s Republic; be satisfied with even the smallest
progress, and treat the outcome of it all as unimportant.</p>
<p>That to be remembered is worthless. Like fame. Like everything.</p>
<p>All that you see will soon have vanished, and those who see it
vanish will vanish themselves, and the ones who reached old age have
no advantage over the untimely dead.</p>
<p>Either the gods have power or they don’t. If they don’t, why pray?
If they do, then why not pray for something else instead of for things
to happen or not to happen? Pray not to feel fear. Or desire, or
grief. If the gods can do anything, they can surely do that for us.</p>
<p>Not “some way to sleep with her”—but a way to stop wanting to.</p>
<p>Not “some way to get rid of him”—but a way to stop trying.</p>
<p>Not “some way to save my child”—but a way to lose your fear.</p>
<p>Redirect your prayers like that, and watch what happens.</p>
<p>When you run up against someone else’s shamelessness, ask yourself
this: Is a world without shamelessness possible?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Then don’t ask the impossible. There have to be shameless people in
the world. This is one of them.</p>
<p>The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other
defect. Remembering that the whole class has to exist will make you
more tolerant of its members.</p>
<p>Another useful point to bear in mind: What qualities has nature given
us to counter that defect? As an antidote to unkindness it gave us
kindness. And other qualities to balance other flaws.</p>
<p>And when others stray off course, you can always try to set them
straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something wrong—doing
something the wrong way .</p>
<p>And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people
you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your
mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish
people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of about that?
Isn’t it yourself you should reproach—for not anticipating that they’d
act this way? The logos gave you the means to see it—that a given
person would act a given way—but you paid no attention. And now you’re
astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone
“untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was
you who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved
your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in
return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What
else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that
you’ve done what your</p>
<p>nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected
a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were
made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing
their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we
do help others—or help them to do something—we’re doing what we were
designed for. We perform our function.</p>
<p>To my soul:</p>
<p>Are you ever going to achieve goodness? Ever going to be simple,
whole, and naked—as plain to see as the body that contains you? Know
what an affectionate and loving disposition would feel like? Ever be
fulfilled, ever stop desiring—lusting and longing for people and
things to enjoy? Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other
place or country—“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to get
along with? And instead be satisfied with what you have, and accept
the present—all of it. And convince yourself that everything is the
gift of the gods, that things are good and always will be, whatever
they decide and have in store for the preservation of that perfect
entity—good and just and beautiful, creating all things, connecting
and embracing them, and gathering in their separated fragments to
create more like them.</p>
<p>Everything that happens is either endurable or not.</p>
<p>If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.</p>
<p>If it’s unendurable … then stop complaining. Your destruction will
mean its end as well.</p>
<p>Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable,
by treating it as in your interest to do so.</p>
<p>In your interest, or in your nature.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that “sanity” means understanding things—each individual
thing—for what they are. And not losing the thread.</p>
<p>And “cooperation” means accepting what nature assigns you—accepting it
willingly.</p>
<p>And “disinterest” means that the intelligence should rise above the
movements of the flesh—the rough and the smooth alike. Should rise
above fame, above death, and everything like them.</p>
<p>If you maintain your claim to these epithets—without caring if others
apply them to you or not—you’ll become a new person, living a new
life. To keep on being the person that you’ve been—to keep being
mauled and degraded by the life you’re living—is to be devoid of sense
and much too fond of life. Like those animal fighters at the
games—torn half to pieces, covered in blood and gore, and still
pleading to be held over till tomorrow … to be bitten and clawed
again.</p>
<p>He has stripped away his body and—realizing that at some point
soon he will have to abandon mankind and leave all this behind—has
dedicated himself to serving justice in all he does, and nature in all
that happens. What people say or think about him, or how they treat
him, isn’t something he worries about. Only these two questions: Is
what he’s doing now the right thing to be doing? Does he accept and
welcome what he’s been assigned? He has stripped away all other
occupations, all other tasks. He wants only to travel a straight
path—to God, by way of law.</p>
<p>How they act when they eat and sleep and mate and defecate and all
the rest. Then when they order and exult, or rage and thunder from on
high. And yet, just consider the things they submitted to a moment
ago, and the reasons for it—and the things they’ll submit to again
before very long.</p>
<p>When you look at yourself, see any of the emperors.</p>
<p>And the same with everyone else. Then let it hit you: Where are they
now?</p>
<p>Nowhere … or wherever.</p>
<p>That way you’ll see human life for what it is. Smoke. Nothing.
Especially when you recall that once things alter they cease to exist
through all the endless years to come.</p>
<p>Then why such turmoil? To live your brief life rightly, isn’t that
enough?</p>
<p>The raw material you’re missing, the opportunities …! What is any of
this but training—training for your logos , in life observed
accurately, scientifically.</p>
<p>So keep at it, until it’s fully digested. As a strong stomach digests
whatever it eats. As a blazing fire takes whatever you throw on it,
and makes it light and flame.</p>
<p>None of us have much time. And yet you act as if things were
eternal—the way you fear and long for them.…</p>
<p>Before long, darkness. And whoever buries you mourned in their turn.</p>
<p>So too a healthy mind should be prepared for anything. The one that
keeps saying, “Are my children all right?” or “Everyone must approve
of me” is like eyes that can only stand pale colors, or teeth that can
handle only mush.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how good a life you’ve led. There’ll still be
people standing around the bed who will welcome the sad event.</p>
<p>Even with the intelligent and good. Won’t there be someone thinking
“Finally! To be through with that old schoolteacher. Even though he
never said anything, you could always feel him judging you.” And
that’s for a good man. How many traits do you have that would make a
lot of people glad to be rid of you?</p>
<p>Remember that, when the time comes. You’ll be less reluctant to leave
if you can tell yourself, “This is the sort of life I’m leaving. Even
the people around me, the ones I spent so much time fighting for,
praying over, caring about—even they want me gone, in hopes that it
will make their own lives easier. How could anyone stand a longer stay
here?”</p>
<p>And yet, don’t leave angry with them. Be true to who you are: caring,
sympathetic, kind. And not as if you were being torn away from life.
But the way it is when someone dies peacefully, how the soul is
released from the body—that’s how you should leave them. It was nature
that bound you to them—that tied the knot. And nature that now unties
you.</p>
<p>I am released from those around me. Not dragged against my will, but
unresisting.</p>
<p>There are things that nature demands. And this is one of them.</p>
<p>Learn to ask of all actions, “Why are they doing that?”</p>
<p>Starting with your own.</p>
<p>That you’ve made enough mistakes yourself. You’re just like them.</p>
<p>Even if there are some you’ve avoided, you have the potential.</p>
<p>Even if cowardice has kept you from them. Or fear of what people would
say. Or some equally bad reason.</p>
<p>That you don’t know for sure it is a mistake. A lot of things are
means to some other end. You have to know an awful lot before you can
judge other people’s actions with real understanding.</p>
<p>When you lose your temper, or even feel irritated: that human life
is very short. Before long all of us will be laid out side by side.</p>
<p>How much more damage anger and grief do than the things that
cause them.</p>
<p>And along with not getting angry at others, try not to pander either.
Both are forms of selfishness; both of them will do you harm. When you
start to lose your temper, remember: There’s nothing manly about rage.
It’s courtesy and kindness that define a human being—and a man. That’s
who possesses strength and nerves and guts, not the angry whiners. To
react like that brings you closer to impassivity—and so to strength.
Pain is the opposite of strength, and so is anger. Both are things we
suffer from, and yield to.…</p>
<p>Four habits of thought to watch for, and erase from your mind when
you catch them. Tell yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>This thought is unnecessary.</li>
<li>This one is destructive to the people around you.</li>
<li>This wouldn’t be what you really think (to say what you don’t
think—the definition of absurdity).</li>
</ul>
<p>And the fourth reason for self-reproach: that the more divine part of
you has been beaten and subdued by the degraded mortal part—the body
and its stupid self-indulgence.</p>
<p>As you kiss your son good night, says Epictetus, whisper to
yourself, “He may be dead in the morning.”</p>
<p>Don’t tempt fate, you say.</p>
<p>By talking about a natural event? Is fate tempted when we speak of
grain being reaped?</p>
<p>Everything you’re trying to reach—by taking the long way round—you
could have right now, this moment. If you’d only stop thwarting your
own attempts. If you’d only let go of the past, entrust the future to
Providence, and guide the present toward reverence and justice.</p>
<p>Reverence: so you’ll accept what you’re allotted. Nature intended it
for you, and you for it.</p>
<p>Justice: so that you’ll speak the truth, frankly and without evasions,
and act as you should—and as other people deserve.</p>
<p>If you can cut yourself—your mind—free of what other people do and
say, of what you’ve said or done, of the things that you’re afraid
will happen, the impositions of the body that contains you and the
breath within, and what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so
that the mind is freed from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life
on its own recognizance—doing what’s right, accepting what happens,
and speaking the truth—</p>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other
people, but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god
appeared to us—or a wise human being, even—and prohibited us from
concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately
shouting it out, we wouldn’t make it through a single day. That’s how
much we value other people’s opinions—instead of our own.</p>
<p>“But I’ve only gotten through three acts …!”</p>
<p>Yes. This will be a drama in three acts, the length fixed by the power
that directed your creation, and now directs your dissolution. Neither
was yours to determine.</p>
<p>So make your exit with grace—the same grace shown to you.</p>
