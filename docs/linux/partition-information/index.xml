    <description>Partition Information Partition information is stored on the disk in a small region, which is read by the operating system at boot time. This region is referred to as the Master Boot Record (MBR) on the BIOS-based systems, and GUID Partition Table (GPT) on the UEFI-based systems. At system boot, the BIOS/UEFI scans all storage devices, detects the presence of MBR/GPT areas, identifies the boot disks, loads the bootloader program in memory from the default boot disk, executes the boot code to read the partition table and identify the /boot partition, loads the kernel in memory, and passes control over to it. Though MBR and GPT store disk partition information and the boot code.</description>
