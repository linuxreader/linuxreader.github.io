    <description>Thin Provisioning Allows for an economical allocation and utilization of storage space by moving arbitrary data blocks to contiguous locations, which results in empty block elimination. Can create a thin pool of storage space and assign volumes much larger storage space than the physical capacity of the pool. Workloads begin consuming the actual allocated space for data writing. When a preset custom threshold (80%, for instance) on the actual consumption of the physical storage in the pool is reached, expand the pool dynamically by adding more physical storage to it. The volumes will automatically start exploiting the new space right away. helps prevent spending more money upfront.</description>
