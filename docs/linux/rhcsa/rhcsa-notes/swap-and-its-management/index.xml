    <description>Swap and its Management Move pages of idle data between physical memory and swap.&#xA;Swap areas act as extensions to the physical memory.&#xA;May be activated or deactivated independent of swap spaces located in other partitions and volumes.&#xA;The system splits the physical memory into small logical chunks called pages and maps their physical locations to virtual locations on the swap to facilitate access by system processors.&#xA;This physical-to-virtual mapping of pages is stored in a data structure called page table, and it is maintained by the kernel.</description>
