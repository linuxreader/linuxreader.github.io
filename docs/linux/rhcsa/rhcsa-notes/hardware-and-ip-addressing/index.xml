    <description>Hardware and IP Addressing Ethernet Address 48-bit address that is used to identify the correct destination node for data packets transmitted from the source node. The data packets include hardware addresses for the source and the destination node. Also referred to as the hardware, physical, link layer, or MAC address. List all network interfaces with their ethernet addresses:&#xA;ip addr | grep ether Subnetting Network address space is divided into several smaller and more manageable logical subnetworks (subnets). Benefits: Reduced network traffic Improved network performance de-centralized and easier administration uses the node bits only Results in the reduction of usable addresses. All nodes in a given subnet have the same subnet mask. Each subnet acts as an isolated network and requires a router to talk to other subnets. The first and the last IP address in a subnet are reserved. The first address points to the subnet itself, and the last address is the broadcast address. IPv4 View current ipv4 address:</description>
