Lab: Tilde expansion Display user’s home directory: echo ~ Display the current directory: echo ~&#43; Display the previous working directory: echo ~- Display user1’s home directory: echo ~user1 cd into the home directory of user1 and confirm: cd ~user1 pwd cd into a subdirectory: cd ~/Documents/ View directory information of the root user’s desktop: ls -ld ~root/Desktop Lab: Command Aliasing shows all aliases that are currently set for user1: su - user1 alias Run alias as root: alias Create an alias “search” to abbreviate the find command with several switches and arguments. Enclose the entire command within single quotation marks (‘’) to ensure white spaces are taken care of. Do not leave any spaces before and after the equal sign (=). alias search=&#39;find / -name core -exec ls -l {} \;&#39; Search with the new alias: search Create and alias by the same name as rm command but adding the -i flag: alias rm=&#39;rm -i&#39; Run rm without using the alias: rm file1 Remove the two aliases we just created: unalias search rm Lab: Wildcards and Metacharacters List all files in the /etc directory that begin with letters “ma” and followed by any characters: ls /etc/ma* List all hidden files and directories in /home/user1: ls -d .* List all files in the /var/log directory that end in “.log”: ls /var/log/*.log List all files and directories under /var/log with exactly four characters in their names: ls -d /var/log/???? Include all files and directories that begin with either of the two characters and followed by any number of characters. ls /usr/bin/[yw]* Match all directory names that begin with any letter between “m” and “o” in the /etc/systemd/system directory: ls -d /etc/systemd/system/[m-o]* Inverse results of the previous: ls -d /etc/systemd/system/[!m-o]* Lab: Piping Pipe the output to the less command in order to view the directory listing one screenful at a time: ls -l /etc | less Run the last command and pipe the output to nl to number each line: last | nl Send the output of ls to grep for the lines that do not contain the pattern “root”. Piped again for a case-insensitive selection of all lines that exclude the pattern “dec”. Number the output, and show the last four lines on the display: ls -l /proc | grep -v root | grep -iv dec | nl | tail -4 Lab: Quoting Mechanisms Remove a file called * without deleting everything in the directory: rm \* Display $LOGNAME without expanding the LOGNAME variable: echo &#39;$LOGNAME&#39; Run the following with double quotes and without: echo &#34;$SHELL&#34; echo &#34;\$PWD&#34; echo &#34;&#39;\&#39;&#34; Lab: grep and regex Search for the pattern “operator” in the /etc/passwd file: grep operator /etc/passwd Search for the space-separated pattern “aliases and functions” in the $HOME/.bashrc file: grep &#39;aliases and functions&#39; .bashrc Search for the pattern “nologin” in the passwd file and exclude (-v) the lines in the output that contain this pattern. Add the -n switch to show the line numbers associated with the matched lines. grep -nv nologin /etc/passwd Find any duplicate entries for the root user in the passwd file. Prepend the caret sign (^) to the pattern “root” to mark the beginning of a line. grep ^root /etc/passwd Identify all users in the passwd file with bash as their primary shell. grep bash$ /etc/passwd Show the entire login.defs file but exclude all the empty lines: grep -v ^$ /etc/login.defs Perform a case-insensitive search (-i) for all the lines in the /etc/bashrc file that match the pattern “path.” grep -i path /etc/bashrc Print all the lines from the /etc/lvm/lvm.conf file that contain an exact match for a word (-w) “acce” followed by exactly two characters: grep -w acce.. /etc/lvm/lvm.conf Print all the lines from the ls command output that include either (-E) the pattern “cron” or “ly”. ls -l /etc | grep -E &#39;cron|ly&#39; Show all the lines from the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file but exclude (-v) the empty lines and commented lines. Use the -e flag multiple times instead of | for either or. sudo grep -ve ^$ -ve ^# /etc/ssh/sshd_config Learn more about regex: man 7 regex Consult the grep man pages: man grep Lab: Managing jobs Issue the jobs command with the -l switch to view all the jobs running in the background: jobs -l bring job ID 1 to the foreground and start running it: fg %1 Suspend job 1 with ctrl&#43;z and then let it run in the background: bg %1 Terminate job ID 1, supply its PID (31726) to the kill command: kill 31726 Lab: Shell Startup Files View the first 10 lines of /etc/bashrc: head /etc/bashrc View the first 10 lines of /etc/profile: head /etc/profile View the directory /etc/profile.d ls -l /etc/profile.d/ View .bashrc cat ~/.bashrc View .bash_profile cat ~/.bash_profile Lab: Customize the Command Prompt (user1) Permanently customize the primary shell prompt to display “&lt;user1@server1 in /etc &gt;:” when this user switches into the /etc directory. The prompt should always reflect the current directory directory path. vim ~/.bash_profile export PS1=&#39;$USERNAME $PWD&#39; Lab 7-2: Redirect the Standard Input, Output, and Error (user1) Run the ls command on /etc, /dvd, and /var. Have the output printed on the screen and the errors forwarded to file /tmp/ioerror. ls /etc /dvd /var 2&gt; /tmp/ioerror Check the file after the command execution and analyze the results: cat /tmp/ioerror">
