Do not leave any spaces before and after the equal sign (=). alias search=&#39;find / -name core -exec ls -l {} \;&#39; Search with the new alias: search Create and alias by the same name as rm command but adding the -i flag: alias rm=&#39;rm -i&#39; Run rm without using the alias: rm file1 Remove the two aliases we just created: unalias search rm Lab: Wildcards and Metacharacters List all files in the /etc directory that begin with letters “ma” and followed by any characters: ls /etc/ma* List all hidden files and directories in /home/user1: ls -d .* List all files in the /var/log directory that end in “.log”: ls /var/log/*.log List all files and directories under /var/log with exactly four characters in their names: ls -d /var/log/???? Include all files and directories that begin with either of the two characters and followed by any number of characters. ls /usr/bin/[yw]* Match all directory names that begin with any letter between “m” and “o” in the /etc/systemd/system directory: ls -d /etc/systemd/system/[m-o]* Inverse results of the previous: ls -d /etc/systemd/system/[!m-o]* Lab: Piping Pipe the output to the less command in order to view the directory listing one screenful at a time: ls -l /etc | less Run the last command and pipe the output to nl to number each line: last | nl Send the output of ls to grep for the lines that do not contain the pattern “root”. Piped again for a case-insensitive selection of all lines that exclude the pattern “dec”. Number the output, and show the last four lines on the display: ls -l /proc | grep -v root | grep -iv dec | nl | tail -4 Lab: Quoting Mechanisms Remove a file called * without deleting everything in the directory: rm \* Display $LOGNAME without expanding the LOGNAME variable: echo &#39;$LOGNAME&#39; Run the following with double quotes and without: echo &#34;$SHELL&#34; echo &#34;\$PWD&#34; echo &#34;&#39;\&#39;&#34; Lab: grep and regex Search for the pattern “operator” in the /etc/passwd file: grep operator /etc/passwd Search for the space-separated pattern “aliases and functions” in the $HOME/.bashrc file: grep &#39;aliases and functions&#39; .bashrc Search for the pattern “nologin” in the passwd file and exclude (-v) the lines in the output that contain this pattern. Add the -n switch to show the line numbers associated with the matched lines. grep -nv nologin /etc/passwd Find any duplicate entries for the root user in the passwd file. Prepend the caret sign (^) to the pattern “root” to mark the beginning of a line. grep ^root /etc/passwd Identify all users in the passwd file with bash as their primary shell. grep bash$ /etc/passwd Show the entire login.defs file but exclude all the empty lines: grep -v ^$ /etc/login.defs Perform a case-insensitive search (-i) for all the lines in the /etc/bashrc file that match the pattern “path.” grep -i path /etc/bashrc Print all the lines from the /etc/lvm/lvm.conf file that contain an exact match for a word (-w) “acce” followed by exactly two characters: grep -w acce.. /etc/lvm/lvm.conf Print all the lines from the ls command output that include either (-E) the pattern “cron” or “ly”. ls -l /etc | grep -E &#39;cron|ly&#39; Show all the lines from the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file but exclude (-v) the empty lines and commented lines. Use the -e flag multiple times instead of | for either or. sudo grep -ve ^$ -ve ^# /etc/ssh/sshd_config Learn more about regex: man 7 regex Consult the grep man pages: man grep Lab: Managing jobs Issue the jobs command with the -l switch to view all the jobs running in the background: jobs -l bring job ID 1 to the foreground and start running it: fg %1 Suspend job 1 with ctrl&#43;z and then let it run in the background: bg %1 Terminate job ID 1, supply its PID (31726) to the kill command: kill 31726 Lab: Shell Startup Files View the first 10 lines of /etc/bashrc: head /etc/bashrc View the first 10 lines of /etc/profile: head /etc/profile View the directory /etc/profile.d ls -l /etc/profile.d/ View .bashrc cat ~/.bashrc View .bash_profile cat ~/.bash_profile Lab: Customize the Command Prompt (user1) Permanently customize the primary shell prompt to display “&lt;user1@server1 in /etc &gt;:” when this user switches into the /etc directory. The prompt should always reflect the current directory directory path. vim ~/.bash_profile export PS1=&#39;$USERNAME $PWD&#39; Lab 7-2: Redirect the Standard Input, Output, and Error (user1) Run the ls command on /etc, /dvd, and /var. Have the output printed on the screen and the errors forwarded to file /tmp/ioerror. ls /etc /dvd /var 2&gt; /tmp/ioerror Check the file after the command execution and analyze the results: cat /tmp/ioerror">
