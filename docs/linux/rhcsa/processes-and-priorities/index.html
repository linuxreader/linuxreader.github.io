<p>Process</p>
<ul>

<li>any program, application, or command that runs on the system.</li>
<li>created in memory when a program, application, or command is initiated.</li>
<li>organized in a hierarchical fashion.</li>
<li>Each process has a parent process (a.k.a. a calling process) that spawns it.</li>
<li>A single parent process may have one or many child processes

<li>passes many of its attributes to them at the time of their creation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each process is assigned an exclusive identification number (Process IDentifier (PID))
<ul>
<li>is used by the kernel to manage and control the process through its lifecycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When a process completes its lifespan or is terminated, this event is reported back to its parent process, and all the resources provisioned to it (cpu cycles, memory, etc.) are then freed and the PID is removed from the system.</li>
