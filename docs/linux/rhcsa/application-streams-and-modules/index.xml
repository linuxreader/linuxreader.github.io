    <description>Application Streams and Modules Application Streams&#xA;Introduced in RHEL 8. Employs a modular approach to organize multiple versions of a software application alongside its dependencies to be available for installation from a single repository. module&#xA;Logical set of application packages that includes everything required to install it, including the executables, libraries, documentation, tools, and utilities as well as dependent components. Modularity gives the flexibility to choose the version of software based on need. In older RHEL releases, each version of a package would have to come from a separate repository. (This has changed in RHEL 8.) Now modules of a single application with different versions can be stored and made available for installation from a common repository. The package management tool has also been enhanced to manipulate modules. RHEL 9 is shipped with two core repositories called BaseOS and Application Stream (AppStream).
