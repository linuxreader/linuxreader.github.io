    <description>Disk Partitions Be careful when adding a new partition to elude data corruption with overlapping an extant partition or wasting storage by leaving unused space between adjacent partitions. Disk allocated at the time of installation is recognized as sda (s for SATA, SAS, or SCSI device) disk a, first partition identified as sda1 and the second partition as sda2. Any subsequent disks added to the system will be known as sdb, sdc, sdd, and so on, and will use 1, 2, 3, etc. for partition numbering. Use lsblk to list disk and partition information.</description>
