    <description>Secure Shell Service DIY Labs Lab: Establish Key-Based Authentication Create user account user20 on both systems and assign a password. [root@server40 ~]# adduser user20 [root@server40 ~]# passwd user20 Changing password for user user20. New password: BAD PASSWORD: The password is shorter than 8 characters Retype new password: passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. As user20 on server40, generate a private/public key pair without a passphrase using the ssh-keygen command. [user20@server40 ~]# ssh-keygen -N &#34;&#34; -q Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): Distribute the public key to server30 with the ssh-copy-id command. [user20@server40 ~]# ssh-copy-id server30 Log on to server30 as user20 and accept the fingerprints for the server if presented. [user20@server40 ~]# ssh server30 Activate the web console with: systemctl enable --now cockpit.socket Register this system with Red Hat Insights: insights-client --register Create an account or view all your systems at https://red.ht/insights-dashboard Last login: Fri Jul 19 14:09:22 2024 [user20@server30 ~]# On subsequent log in attempts from server40 to server30, user20 should not be prompted for their password. Lab: Test the Effect of PermitRootLogin Directive As user1 with sudo on server30, edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and change the value of the directive PermitRootLogin to “no”. [user1@server30 ~]$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config</description>
