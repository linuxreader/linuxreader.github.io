    <description>Advanced Container Management Preset environment variables may be passed when launching containers or new variables may be set for containerized applications to consume for proper operation. Information stored during an application execution is lost when a container is restarted or erased. This behavior can be overridden by making a directory on the host available inside the container for saving data persistently. Containers may be configured to start and stop with the transitioning of the host system via the systemd service. These advanced tasks are also performed with the podman command. Containers and Port Mapping Applications running in different containers often need to exchange data for proper operation. For instance, a containerized Apache web server may need to talk to a MySQL database instance running in a different container. It may also need to talk to the outside world over a port such as 80 or 8080. To support this traffic flow, appropriate port mappings are established between the host system and each container. EXAM TIP: As a normal user, you cannot map a host port below 1024 to a container port.</description>
